This evening in Kabul, as you all know, terrorists attacked\u2014that we\u2019ve been talking about and worried about, that the intelligence community has assessed&nbsp;has&nbsp;[was] undertaken\u2014an attack\u2014by a group known as ISIS-K\u2014took the lives of American service members standing guard at the airport, and wounded several others seriously. They also wounded a number of civilians, and civilians were killed as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ve been engaged all day and in constant contact with the military commanders here in Washington, the Pentagon, as well as in Afghanistan and Doha. And my commanders here in Washington and in the field have been on this with great detail, and you\u2019ve had a chance to speak to some, so far.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe situation on the ground is still evolving, and I\u2019m constantly being updated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese American service members who gave their lives\u2014it\u2019s an overused word, but it\u2019s totally appropriate\u2014they were heroes. Heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were part of an airlift, an evacuation effort unlike any seen in history, with more than 100,000 American citizens, American partners, Afghans who helped us, and others taken to safety in the last 11 days. Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the \u201cbackbone of America.\u201d They\u2019re the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJill and I\u2014our hearts ache, like I\u2019m sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we\u2019re outraged as well as heartbroken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war\u2014when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain\u2014who we lost.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there\u2019s no way out. My heart aches for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you\u2014the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of\u2014the fallen this day, they\u2019re part of a great and noble company of American heroes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past few weeks\u2014I know you\u2019re\u2014many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it\u2014we\u2019ve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K\u2014an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened\u2014has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is why, from the outset, I\u2019ve repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed\u2014this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We\u2019ve known that from the beginning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd as I\u2019ve been in constant contact with our senior military leaders\u2014and I mean constant, around the clock\u2014and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve ordered them to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmerica will not be intimidated.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need\u2014what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon, and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, \u201cWhom shall I send\u2026who shall go for us?\u201d And the American military has been answering for a long time: \u201cHere am I, Lord. Send me.\u201d \u201cHere I am. Send me.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm\u2019s way, to risk everything\u2014not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform\u2014military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(A moment of silence is taken.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you. May God bless you all. And may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It\u2019s within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them and we will get them out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLadies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O\u2019Donnell of NBC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today\u2019s attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are you\u2014are you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ve instructed the military, whatever they need\u2014if they need additional force\u2014I will grant it. But the military\u2014from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the field\u2014have all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they are\u2014not certain\u2014and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Wherever they are.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrevor from Reuters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we\u2019re in a situation\u2014we inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days before\u2014in 11 days\u2014that it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it\u2019s in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a consequence of that, the major things we\u2019ve asked them\u2014moving back the perimeter; give me more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming through\u2014it is not what you\u2019d call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. is\u2014the military is\u2014but they\u2019re acting in their interest\u2014their interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, by and large\u2014and I\u2019ve asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it\u2019s a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we\u2019re just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it\u2019s in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out; over 5,000 Americans overall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, it\u2019s not a matter of trust, it\u2019s a matter of mutual self-interest. And\u2014but there is no evidence thus far that I\u2019ve been given, as a consequence by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue for\u2014beyond today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAamer, Associated Press.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mind\u2014and also what you\u2019ve said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attack\u2014how do you weigh staying even one more day, considering what\u2019s happened?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because I think what America says matters. What we say we\u2019re going to do and the context in which we say we\u2019re going to do it, that we do it\u2014unless something exceptional changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women\u2019s groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd our military\u2014and, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attack\u2014the military has concluded that\u2019s what we should do. I think they\u2019re right. I think they\u2019re correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd after that, we\u2019re going to be in a circumstance where there are\u2014will be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban. They\u2019re not good guys, the Taliban. I\u2019m not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don\u2019t have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so there\u2019s a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, there\u2019s not many left that we can assess that are\u2014want to come out. There\u2019s some Americans we\u2019ve identified\u2014we\u2019ve contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of them\u2014who don\u2019t want to leave because they have sig-\u2014they\u2019re dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there\u2019s others who are looking for the time. So, that\u2019s why we continue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ll take a few more questions, and\u2014but, you, sir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t pick you, but that\u2019s okay. (Laughs.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: I wanted to ask you\u2014you say that \u201cwhat America says matters.\u201d What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31st? What \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I say \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: What do you say to them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u2014we\u2019re going to continue to try to get you out. It matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook, I know of no conflict, as a student of history\u2014no conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd think about it, folks. I think it\u2019s important for\u2014I know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they\u2019d be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, getting every single person out is\u2014can\u2019t be guaranteed to anybody because there\u2019s a determination, all who wants to get out as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt any rate, it\u2019s a process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was really pointing to you, but\u2014you, sir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold, or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done on the\u2014ask this\u2014I\u2019ll answer the last question, first.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan\u2014the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey concluded\u2014the military\u2014that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so, I followed that recommendation.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regard to\u2014there are certain circumstances where we\u2019ve gotten information\u2014and quite frankly, sometimes from some of you\u2014saying, \u201cYou know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out and they\u2019re on a bus, they\u2019re moving\u2026\u201d\u2014from other people\u2014\u201cand this is their location.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, \u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cThis bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, yes, there have been occasions like that.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred\u2014they\u2019ve been let through. But I can\u2019t tell you with any certitude that there\u2019s actually been a list of names. I don\u2019t\u2014there may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not\u2014it didn\u2019t exist, that, \u201cHere\u2019s the names of 12 people; they\u2019re coming. Let them through.\u201d It could very well have happened.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ll take one more question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President, can I \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President, right here. Mr. President \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Is that\u2014is there\u2014thank you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s you. (Laughter.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 Marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that\u2019s happened of late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut here\u2019s the deal: You know\u2014I wish you\u2019d one day say these things\u2014you know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn return, the commitment was made\u2014and that was a year before\u2014in return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember that? I\u2019m being serious.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I\u2014I\u2019m asking you a question. Be a\u2014because before I \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Donald Trump is not the President right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no\u2014now wait a minute. I\u2019m asking you a question. Is that\u2014is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: I know what you\u2019re talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully\u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ:\u2014since\u2014I don\u2019t think that the issue that\u2014do you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan, or just the way that things have happened?&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurt\u2014some, as we\u2019ve seen, have gotten killed\u2014and that it is messy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason why\u2014whether my friend will acknowledge it and was\u2014reported it\u2014the reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: \u201cI will be out by May 1st. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans.\u201d That was the deal. That\u2019s why no American was attacked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: And you said that you still\u2014a few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folks\u2014and I\u2019m going to\u2014I have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we\u2019d be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019d have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relative\u2014is why the reason we went in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan\u2014a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country, and is made up\u2014and I don\u2019t mean this in a derogatory\u2014made up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, as I said before\u2014and this is the last comment I\u2019ll make, but we\u2019ll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we\u2019re not out yet\u2014if Osama bin Laden, as well as al Qaeda, had chosen to launch an attack\u2014when they left Saudi Arabia\u2014out of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know it\u2019s not fair to ask you questions. It\u2019s rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur interest in going was to prevent al Qaeda from reemerging\u2014first to get bin Laden, wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I\u2019ve said 100 times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe don\u2019t have military encampments there; we don\u2019t keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLadies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you so much.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Been a tough day.

Just in the last 12 hours or so, another 7,000 have gotten out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were part of the bravest, most capable, and the most selfless military on the face of the Earth. And they were part of, simply, what I call the \u201cbackbone of America.\u201d They\u2019re the spine of America, the best the country has to offer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJill and I\u2014our hearts ache, like I\u2019m sure all of you do as well, for all those Afghan families who have lost loved ones, including small children, or been wounded in this vicious attack. And we\u2019re outraged as well as heartbroken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing the father of an Army major who served for a year in Iraq and, before that, was in Kosovo as a U.S. attorney for the better part of six months in the middle of a war\u2014when he came home after a year in Iraq, he was diagnosed, like many, many coming home, with an aggressive and lethal cancer of the brain\u2014who we lost.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have some sense, like many of you do, what the families of these brave heroes are feeling today. You get this feeling like you\u2019re being sucked into a black hole in the middle of your chest; there\u2019s no way out. My heart aches for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I know this: We have a continuing obligation, a sacred obligation to all of you\u2014the families of those heroes. That obligation is not temporary; it lasts forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lives we lost today were lives given in the service of liberty, the service of security, in the service of others, in the service of America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike their fellow brothers and sisters in arms who died defending our vision and our values in the struggle against terrorism of\u2014the fallen this day, they\u2019re part of a great and noble company of American heroes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past few weeks\u2014I know you\u2019re\u2014many of you are probably tired of hearing me say it\u2014we\u2019ve been made aware by our intelligence community that the ISIS-K\u2014an arch-enemy of the Taliban; people who were freed when both those prisons were opened\u2014has been planning a complex set of attacks on the United States personnel and others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is why, from the outset, I\u2019ve repeatedly said this mission was extraordinarily dangerous and why I have been so determined to limit the duration of this mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd as General McKenzie said, this is why our mission was designed\u2014this is the way it was designed to operate: operate under severe stress and attack. We\u2019ve known that from the beginning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd as I\u2019ve been in constant contact with our senior military leaders\u2014and I mean constant, around the clock\u2014and our commanders on the ground and throughout the day, they made it clear that we can and we must complete this mission, and we will. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve ordered them to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ve also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose, and the moment of our choosing.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is what you need to know: These ISIS terrorists will not win. We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get out our Afghan allies out, and our mission will go on.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmerica will not be intimidated.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have the utmost confidence in our brave service members who continue to execute this mission with courage and honor to save lives and get Americans, our partners, our Afghan allies out of Afghanistan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery day when I talk to our commanders, I ask them what they need\u2014what more do they need, if anything, to get the job done. As they will tell you, I granted every request.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI reiterated to them again today, on three occasions, that they should take the maximum steps necessary to protect our forces on the ground in Kabul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I also want to thank the Secretary of Defense and the military leadership at the Pentagon, and all the commanders in the field. There has been complete unanimity from every commander on the objectives of this mission and the best way to achieve those objectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who have served through the ages have drawn inspiration from the Book of Isaiah, when the Lord says, \u201cWhom shall I send\u2026who shall go for us?\u201d And the American military has been answering for a long time: \u201cHere am I, Lord. Send me.\u201d \u201cHere I am. Send me.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach one of these women and men of our armed forces are the heirs of that tradition of sacrifice of volunteering to go into harm\u2019s way, to risk everything\u2014not for glory, not for profit, but to defend what we love and the people we love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I ask that you join me now in a moment of silence for all those in uniform and out uniform\u2014military and civilian, who have given the last full measure of devotion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(A moment of silence is taken.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you. May God bless you all. And may God protect those troops and all those standing watch for America. We have so much to do. It\u2019s within our capacity to do it. We just have to remain steadfast. Steadfast.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will complete our mission. And we will continue, after our troops have withdrawn, to find means by which we defined any American who wishes to get out of Afghanistan. We will find them and we will get them out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLadies and gentlemen, they gave me a list here. The first person I was instructed to call on was Kelly O\u2019Donnell of NBC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ Mr. President, you have said leaving Afghanistan is in the national interest of the United States. After today\u2019s attack, do you believe you will authorize additional forces to respond to that attack inside Afghanistan? And are you\u2014are you prepared to add additional forces to protect those Americans who remain on the ground carrying out the evacuation operation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019ve instructed the military, whatever they need\u2014if they need additional force\u2014I will grant it. But the military\u2014from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, the commanders in the field\u2014have all contacted me one way or another, usually by letter, saying they subscribe to the mission as designed to get as many people out as we can within the timeframe that is allotted. That is the best way, they believe, to get as many Americans out as possible, and others.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd with regard to finding, tracking down the ISIS leaders who ordered this, we have some reason to believe we know who they are\u2014not certain\u2014and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Inside Afghanistan, Mr. President?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Wherever they are.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrevor from Reuters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. There has been some criticism, even from people in your party, about the dependence on the Taliban to secure the perimeter of the airport. Do you feel like there was a mistake made in that regard?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t. Look, I think General McKenzie handled this question very well. The fact is that we\u2019re in a situation\u2014we inherited a situation, particularly since, as we all know, that the Afghan military collapsed 11 days before\u2014in 11 days\u2014that it is in the interest of, as Mackenzie said, in the interest of the Taliban that, in fact, ISIS-K does not metastasize beyond what it is, number one. And number two, it\u2019s in their interest that we are able to leave on time, on target.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a consequence of that, the major things we\u2019ve asked them\u2014moving back the perimeter; give me more space between the wall; stopping vehicles from coming through, et cetera; searching people coming through\u2014it is not what you\u2019d call a tightly commanded, regimented operation like the U.S. is\u2014the military is\u2014but they\u2019re acting in their interest\u2014their interest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, by and large\u2014and I\u2019ve asked this same question to military on the ground, whether or not it\u2019s a useful exercise. No one trusts them; we\u2019re just counting on their self-interest to continue to generate their activities. And it\u2019s in their self-interest that we leave when we said and that we get as many people out as we can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd like I said, even in the midst of everything that happened today, over 7,000 people have gotten out; over 5,000 Americans overall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, it\u2019s not a matter of trust, it\u2019s a matter of mutual self-interest. And\u2014but there is no evidence thus far that I\u2019ve been given, as a consequence by any of our commanders in the field, that there has been collusion between the Taliban and ISIS in carrying out what happened today both in front of the hotel and what is expected to continue for\u2014beyond today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAamer, Associated Press.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. You have spoken again powerfully about your own son and the weight of these decisions. With that in mind\u2014and also what you\u2019ve said: that the longer we stay, the more likelihood that there would be a major attack\u2014how do you weigh staying even one more day, considering what\u2019s happened?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Because I think what America says matters. What we say we\u2019re going to do and the context in which we say we\u2019re going to do it, that we do it\u2014unless something exceptional changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are additional American citizens, there are additional green card holders, there are additional personnel of our allies, there are additional SIV card holders, there are additional Afghans that have helped us, and there are additional groups of individuals that have contacted us from women\u2019s groups, to NGOs, and others, who have expressly indicated they want to get out and have gathered in certain circumstances in groups, on buses and other means, that still presents the opportunity for the next several days, between now and the 31st, to be able to get them out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd our military\u2014and, I believe, to the extent that we can do that knowing the threat, knowing that we may very well have another attack\u2014the military has concluded that\u2019s what we should do. I think they\u2019re right. I think they\u2019re correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd after that, we\u2019re going to be in a circumstance where there are\u2014will be, I believe, numerous opportunities to continue to provide access for additional persons to get out of Afghanistan, either through means that we provide and/or are provided through cooperation with the Taliban. They\u2019re not good guys, the Taliban. I\u2019m not suggesting that at all. But they have a keen interest. As many of you have been reporting, they very much would like to figure out how to keep the airport open. They don\u2019t have the capacity to do it. They very much are trying to figure out whether or not they can maintain what is the portion of an economy that has become not robust, but fundamentally different than it had been.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so there\u2019s a lot of reasons why they have reached out not just to us, but to others, as to why it would be continued in their interest to get more of the personnel we want to get out. We can locate them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, there\u2019s not many left that we can assess that are\u2014want to come out. There\u2019s some Americans we\u2019ve identified\u2014we\u2019ve contacted the vast majority of them, if not all of them\u2014who don\u2019t want to leave because they have sig-\u2014they\u2019re dual nationals, they have extended families, et cetera. And there\u2019s others who are looking for the time. So, that\u2019s why we continue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ll take a few more questions, and\u2014but, you, sir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t pick you, but that\u2019s okay. (Laughs.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: I wanted to ask you\u2014you say that \u201cwhat America says matters.\u201d What do you say to the Afghans who helped troops, who may not be able to get out by August 31st? What \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I say \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: What do you say to them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u2014we\u2019re going to continue to try to get you out. It matters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook, I know of no conflict, as a student of history\u2014no conflict where, when a war was ending, one side was able to guarantee that everyone that wanted to be extracted from that country would get out.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd think about it, folks. I think it\u2019s important for\u2014I know the American people get this in their gut. There are, I would argue, millions of Afghani citizens who are not Taliban; who did not actively cooperate with us as SIVs; who, if given a chance, they\u2019d be onboard a plane tomorrow. It sounds ridiculous, but the vast majority of people in communities like that want to come to America, given a choice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, getting every single person out is\u2014can\u2019t be guaranteed to anybody because there\u2019s a determination, all who wants to get out as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt any rate, it\u2019s a process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was really pointing to you, but\u2014you, sir.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. There are reports that U.S. officials provided the Taliban with names of Americans and Afghan officials to evacuate. Were you aware of that? Did that happen?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then, sir, did you personally reject a recommendation to hold, or to recapture Bagram Air Force Base?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done on the\u2014ask this\u2014I\u2019ll answer the last question, first.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the tactical questions of how to conduct an evacuation or a war, I gather up all the major military personnel that are in Afghanistan\u2014the commanders, as well as the Pentagon. And I ask for their best military judgment: what would be the most efficient way to accomplish the mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey concluded\u2014the military\u2014that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul. And so, I followed that recommendation.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith regard to\u2014there are certain circumstances where we\u2019ve gotten information\u2014and quite frankly, sometimes from some of you\u2014saying, \u201cYou know of such and such a group of people who are trying to get out and they\u2019re on a bus, they\u2019re moving\u2026\u201d\u2014from other people\u2014\u201cand this is their location.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd there have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said, \u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u2014for example, \u201cThis bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through.\u201d&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, yes, there have been occasions like that.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd to the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred\u2014they\u2019ve been let through. But I can\u2019t tell you with any certitude that there\u2019s actually been a list of names. I don\u2019t\u2014there may have been, but I know of no circumstance. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not\u2014it didn\u2019t exist, that, \u201cHere\u2019s the names of 12 people; they\u2019re coming. Let them through.\u201d It could very well have happened.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ll take one more question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President, can I \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President, right here. Mr. President \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Let me take the one question from the most interesting guy that I know in the press.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Thank you, Mr. President. Is that\u2014is there\u2014thank you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s you. (Laughter.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President, there had not been a U.S. service member killed in combat in Afghanistan since February of 2020. You set a deadline. You pulled troops out. You sent troops back in. And now 12 Marines are dead. You said the buck stops with you. Do you bear any responsibility for the way that things have unfolded in the last two weeks?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I bear responsibility for, fundamentally, all that\u2019s happened of late.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut here\u2019s the deal: You know\u2014I wish you\u2019d one day say these things\u2014you know as well as I do that the former President made a deal with the Taliban that he would get all American forces out of Afghanistan by May 1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn return, the commitment was made\u2014and that was a year before\u2014in return, he was given a commitment that the Taliban would continue to attack others, but would not attack any American forces.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRemember that? I\u2019m being serious.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Mr. President \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I\u2014I\u2019m asking you a question. Be a\u2014because before I \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Donald Trump is not the President right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no\u2014now wait a minute. I\u2019m asking you a question. Is that\u2014is that accurate, to the best of your knowledge?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: I know what you\u2019re talking about. But, Mr. President, respectfully\u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ:\u2014since\u2014I don\u2019t think that the issue that\u2014do you think that people have an issue with pulling out of Afghanistan, or just the way that things have happened?&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I think they have an issue that people are likely to get hurt\u2014some, as we\u2019ve seen, have gotten killed\u2014and that it is messy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason why\u2014whether my friend will acknowledge it and was\u2014reported it\u2014the reason why there were no attacks on Americans, as you said, from the date until I came into office, was because the commitment was made by President Trump: \u201cI will be out by May 1st. In the meantime, you agree not to attack any Americans.\u201d That was the deal. That\u2019s why no American was attacked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: And you said that you still\u2014a few days ago, you said you squarely stand by your decision to pull out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. Because look at it this way, folks\u2014and I\u2019m going to\u2014I have another meeting, for real. But imagine where we\u2019d be if I had indicated, on May the 1st, I was not going to renegotiate an evacuation date; we were going to stay there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019d have only one alternative: Pour thousands of more troops back into Afghanistan to fight a war that we had already won, relative\u2014is why the reason we went in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have never been of the view that we should be sacrificing American lives to try to establish a democratic government in Afghanistan\u2014a country that has never once in its entire history been a united country, and is made up\u2014and I don\u2019t mean this in a derogatory\u2014made up of different tribes who have never, ever, ever gotten along with one another.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, as I said before\u2014and this is the last comment I\u2019ll make, but we\u2019ll have more chance to talk about this, unfortunately, beyond, because we\u2019re not out yet\u2014if Osama bin Laden, as well as al Qaeda, had chosen to launch an attack\u2014when they left Saudi Arabia\u2014out of Yemen, would we have ever gone to Afghanistan? Even though the Taliban completely controlled Afghanistan at the time, would we have ever gone?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know it\u2019s not fair to ask you questions. It\u2019s rhetorical. But raise your hand if you think we should have gone and given up thousands of lives and tens of thousands of wounded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur interest in going was to prevent al Qaeda from reemerging\u2014first to get bin Laden, wipe out al Qaeda in Afghanistan, and prevent that from happening again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs I\u2019ve said 100 times: Terrorism has metastasized around the world; we have greater threats coming out of other countries a heck of a lot closer to the United States.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe don\u2019t have military encampments there; we don\u2019t keep people there. We have over-the-horizon capability to keep them from going after us.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLadies and gentlemen, it was time to end a 20-year war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you so much.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Biden_Delivers_Remarks_on_the_Terror_Attack_on_Hamid_Karzai_International_Airport.mp3", "introduction": "<p>On August 26, 2021, a suicide bomber set off explosives at the&nbsp;Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing 13 US service members and dozens of Afghan civilians.
