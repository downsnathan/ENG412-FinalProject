Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make \u2014 give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, on vaccinations: On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58 \u2014 42 days ahead of schedule.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, today, I\u2019m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people\u2019s arms. That\u2019s right: 200 million shots in 100 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know it\u2019s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close \u2014 not even close \u2014 to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd today, we\u2019ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities \u2014 as a consequence of the virus \u2014 by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders \u2014 a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we\u2019re really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we\u2019ll meet that goal as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people\u2019s bank accounts. That\u2019s real money in people\u2019s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority \u2014 a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that\u2019s going to take place this year. They\u2019re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent \u2014 a 6 percent growth in GDP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That\u2019s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZeke, the Associated Press.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I\u2019d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m going to \u2014 look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that\u2019s why I put all my focus in the beginning \u2014 there are a lot of problems \u2014 put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the other problems we\u2019re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they\u2019ve been around a long time. And what we\u2019re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and \u2014 whether it\u2019s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they\u2019re going to lose a family member, whether they\u2019re going to be in a position where they\u2019re not going to be \u2014 they\u2019re going to lose their home because they can\u2019t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to \u2014 to pay their rent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we\u2019re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that\u2019s the reason why I focused as I have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd here\u2019s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to \u2014 is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I\u2019m not going to do that; I\u2019m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And just to \u2014 to follow up, Mr. President, can your presidency be a success if you can\u2019t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that\u2019s going to be for the American people to decide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI think \u2014 you know, I doubt whether \u2014 maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought \u2014 many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People\u2019s lives are changing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo let\u2019s see what happens. All I know, I\u2019ve been hired to solve problems \u2014 to solve problems, not create division.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. How about Yamiche?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thanks so much, Mr. President. You\u2019ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn\u2019t come to this country right now; this isn\u2019t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected \u2014 as a moral, decent man \u2014 is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won\u2019t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with \u2014 run by CPB [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I\u2019m the nice guy; that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s happening \u2014 that I\u2019m a decent man or however it\u2019s phrased. That \u2014 you know, that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming, because they know Biden is a good guy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came \u2014 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of \u2014 in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to that, there is a \u2014 and nobody \u2014 and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That\u2019s not the reason they\u2019re coming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason they\u2019re coming is that it\u2019s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they\u2019re coming because of the circumstances in-country \u2014 in-country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe way to deal with this problem \u2014 and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator \u2014 I mean, Vice President \u2014 putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn\u2019t use it. He didn\u2019t do it. And in addition to that, what he did \u2014 he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and \u2014 and has been \u2014 continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the \u2014 the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those \u2014 those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days \u2014 a little while. But he dismantled all of that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so what we\u2019re doing now is attempting to rebuild \u2014 rebuild the system that can accommodate the \u2014 what is happening today. And I like to think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a nice guy, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back \u2014 are being sent back. Thousands \u2014 tens of thousands of people who are \u2014 who are over 18 years of age and single \u2014 people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We\u2019re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re not getting across the border.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we\u2019re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We\u2019re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers\u2019 arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. Less than \u2014 I think it\u2019s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child \u2014 no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd today, I went to \u2014 for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and \u2014 and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss \u2014 5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we\u2019re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It\u2019s going to take time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the other thing we\u2019re doing, I might add \u2014 am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don\u2019t want the details \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I\u2019ll stop there and fin- \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; My follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families \u2014 why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. The families that are being allowed to stay, why they\u2019re being allowed to stay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there\u2019s \u2014 immigration is a big issue, of course, when it \u2014 related to the filibuster, but there\u2019s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJim Clyburn, someone who \u2014 of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I\u2019m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet\u2019s go to the first question you asked \u2014 the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not \u2014 some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They\u2019re saying they won\u2019t take them back \u2014 not all of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we\u2019re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we\u2019re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s an important point to understand \u2014 I know you understand; I don\u2019t mean to say it that way \u2014 an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States \u2014 a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we\u2019ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there\u2019s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They\u2019re establishing that right off the bat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says \u2014 to take the extreme case \u2014 \u201cI got a birth certificate.\u201d Then guess what? We\u2019re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so that\u2019s going to reduce significantly \u2014 there\u2019s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we\u2019re occupying now \u2014 both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss \u2014 to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that \u2014 it used to be required for the filibuster \u2014 and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them \u2014 that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 \u2014 the filibuster existed \u2014 there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it\u2019s being abused in a gigantic way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are \u2014 are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote \u2014 like the basic right to vote. We\u2019ve amended the filibuster in the past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut here\u2019s the deal: As you observed, I\u2019m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50-50 Senate, we\u2019ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, I\u2019m going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you \u2014 if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to \u2014 anyway \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI \u2014 we\u2019re going to get a lot done. And if we have to \u2014 if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what I\u2019m talking about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min \u2014 Ms. Kim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You\u2019re going to have to \u2014 the existing rule \u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it\u2019s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re going to do about the filibuster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; I\u2019d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old, Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Astounding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; \u2014 and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That\u2019s why she sent him alone from Honduras.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging \u2014 in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process \u2014 encouraging families like Yossell says to come?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the idea that I\u2019m going to say \u2014 which I would never do \u2014 \u201cif an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we\u2019re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\u201d \u2014&nbsp;no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m not going to do it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It\u2019s because of earthquakes, floods. It\u2019s because of lack of food. It\u2019s because of gang violence. It\u2019s because of a whole range of things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat \u2014 when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like \u2014 in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn\u2019t walk in the street because they were getting \u2014 their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, \u201cOkay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I\u2019ll put the lighting in.\u201d We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen this hurricane occurred \u2014 two hurricanes \u2014 instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn\u2019t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We\u2019re going to do a lot in our administration. We\u2019re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat mother did not sit around with \u2014 on the kitchen table and say, \u201cYou know, I got a great idea: The way I\u2019m going to make sure my son get taken care of is I\u2019m going to put a\u2026\u201d \u2014 how old was he, or she?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; He\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s nine. I also met a 10-year-old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: A nine-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and he\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That\u2019s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in \u2014 I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, \u201cYou got to come home and take care of this.\u201d So we put together a plan and it had an impact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, the question here is whether \u2014 how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There\u2019s no easy answer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; A quick follow, if I may. &nbsp;Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not \u2014 and in this young man\u2019s case, he has a mom at home; there\u2019s an overwhelming reason why he\u2019d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas \u2014 I was there \u2014 is at 1,556 percent capacity \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; \u2014 right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who say that they \u2014 some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What\u2019s your reaction \u2014 what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what\u2019s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Is \u2014 that\u2019s a serious question, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs it acceptable to me? Come on. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That\u2019s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely \u2014 not just children, but particularly children \u2014 to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what\u2019s happening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is totally unacceptable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is that it\u2019s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it\u2019s hard to get those troops out. So, what we\u2019ve been doing \u2014 what I\u2019ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing \u2014 has been \u2014 we\u2019ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we\u2019re going to do so in a safe and orderly way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019re in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies, particularly those who have forces there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd General Austin is \u2014 just met with Ghani and I\u2019m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the \u2014 the \u201cleader,\u201d quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there\u2019s a U.N.-led process that\u2019s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people \u2014 how to end this war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it\u2019s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; You just said \u201cif we leave.\u201d Do you think it\u2019s possible that we\u2013<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: We will leave. The question is when we leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Do you \u2014 sorry \u2014 do you believe, though, it\u2019s possible we could have troops there next year?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I can\u2019t picture that being the case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Kristen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We\u2019ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven\u2019t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will commit to transparency, and \u2014 as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd one of the reasons I haven\u2019t gone down \u2014 I have all my \u2014 my chief folks have gone down \u2014 is I don\u2019t want to become the issue. I don\u2019t want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know, to be clear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that\u2019s happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I\u2019m sorry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all \u2014 did not slow up the amount of immigration \u2014 and there\u2019s many people coming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd rolling back the policies of separating children from \u2014 from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and \u2014 I make no apologies for that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested \u2014 number one. We\u2019re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses \u2014 if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now: consulting with our allies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Just a very quick follow-up \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: You\u2019ve only got another hour now, okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ &nbsp;Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters \u2014 the very people who helped to get you elected in November.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you worried that if you don\u2019t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at five o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\u2019s all designed \u2014 and I\u2019m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in \u2014 outside this White House. I\u2019m not talking about the elected officials; I\u2019m talking about voters. Voters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so I am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they\u2019re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from \u2014 from becoming the law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is \u201cyes,\u201d but I\u2019m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven\u2019t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) My predecessor need do [sic] \u2014 needed to. My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Have you \u2014 have you \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d My plan is to run for reelection. That\u2019s my expectation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And then, on \u2014 on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I haven\u2019t at all. I\u2019ve been meeting \u2014 when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work \u2014 we\u2019re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we\u2019re working together on a bunch of things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that \u2014 I would like Republican \u2014 elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I\u2019m doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is \u2014 the last piece of legislation is so far left \u2014 well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Where am I here? Let me see. Kaitlan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I\u2019d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that\u2019s on the filibuster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: That counts as a question, but go ahead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Okay. I\u2019ll make it quick. It\u2019s a quick question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no \u2014 you can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis\u2019s funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a \u201crelic\u201d of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And if not, why not abolish it if it\u2019s a relic of the Jim Crow era?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It\u2019s been abused from the time it came into being \u2014 by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let\u2019s deal with the abuse first.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; It sounds like you\u2019re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I answered your question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I said, \u201cThat is my expectation.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; So is that a \u201cyes\u201d that you are running for reelection?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you guys come from, man. I\u2019ve never been able to travel. I\u2019m a great respecter of fate. I\u2019ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And if you do \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: It \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I would fully expect that to be the case. She\u2019s doing a great job. She\u2019s a great partner. She\u2019s a great partner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And do you believe you\u2019ll be running against former President Trump?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. I don\u2019t even think about \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don\u2019t have to answer my question, but, I mean, you know, do you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI mean, look, this is \u2014 the way I view things \u2014 I\u2019ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that\u2019s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hardworking, decent American people who are getting \u2014 really having it stuck to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you notice \u2014 don\u2019t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had \u2014 if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it \u2014 in dealing with the \u2014 the act that we just passed which puts money in people\u2019s pockets \u2014 ordinary people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDid you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut \u2014 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they\u2019ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It\u2019s kind of amazing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the federal budget is saving people\u2019s lives, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans \u2014 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you\u2019re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is \u2014 something is wrong. Their newfound concern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m concerned \u2014 look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I\u2019m wrong, and I respect that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country \u2014 the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.\u201d The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I\u2019ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, from my perspective, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 to me, it\u2019s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people \u2014 just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have \u2014 make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether \u2014 since he didn\u2019t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I\u2019m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that \u2014 that same \u2014 that same view, that same sense of what is \u2014 you know, what\u2019s appropriate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJustin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you\u2019ve been in office for a couple months. There\u2019s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there\u2019s the continued human rights abuses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, today, I\u2019m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, they\u2019re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter \u2014 my interpreter and his \u2014 going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn\u2019t have a democratic \u2014 with a small \u201cD\u201d \u2014 bone in his body. But he\u2019s a smart, smart guy. He\u2019s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can\u2019t function in an ever \u2014 an ever-complex world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were \u2014 his people were on call as well as mine, listening \u2014 we had a two-hour conversation. For two hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I\u2019ve told him in person on several occasions: that we\u2019re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo, that we\u2019ll have strong competition but we\u2019ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we\u2019re going to deal with China effectively, and we\u2019re going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we\u2019re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we\u2019re \u2014 and I\u2019m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the \u201860s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it\u2019s 0.7 percent. I\u2019m going to change that. We\u2019re going to change that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I\u2019m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the reasons why I\u2019ve set up the \u2014 the&nbsp;PAB&nbsp;[PCAST] \u2014 the President\u2019s board with scientists and the like, again \u2014 is we\u2019re going to invest in medical research \u2014 cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, the things \u2014 industries of the future \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we\u2019re going to make real investments. China is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third \u2014 the second thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to reestablish our alliances. And I\u2019ve been very clear with him, it\u2019s not anti-Chinese. And we\u2019ve talked about it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this \u2014 as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we\u2019ve been going close to an hour. I\u2019m happy to go longer. But one of the things that I\u2019m going to be doing, I\u2019m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly \u2014 I think within the next hour or so. I don\u2019t know the exact time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd earlier this month \u2014 and apparently it got the Chinese\u2019s attention; that\u2019s not why I did it \u2014 I met with our allies and how we\u2019re going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States \u2014 the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore too long, I\u2019m going to have \u2014 I\u2019m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we\u2019re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules \u2014 to follow the rules \u2014 whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands \u2014 he makes no pretense about not understanding what I\u2019m saying any more than I do him \u2014 I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as \u2014 \u201cAnd, Mr. President, as I\u2019ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don\u2019t always live up to our expectations, but it\u2019s a values system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we\u2019re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear \u2014 make it clear what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President \u2014 at least one did \u2014 but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what\u2019s happening to the Uighurs, what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong, what\u2019s happening in-country.\n\r\n\r\n That\u2019s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It\u2019s who we are.\n\r\n\r\n So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don\u2019t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That\u2019s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.\n\r\n\r\n Q&nbsp; All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s not where I make the decision; that\u2019s where I make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China.\n\r\n\r\n Look around the world. We\u2019re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped \u2014 because all the people get to speak \u2014 to compete?\n\r\n\r\n It is clear, absolutely clear \u2014 and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country \u2014 that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.\n\r\n\r\n If you notice, you don\u2019t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It\u2019s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. We\u2019ve got to prove democracy works.\n\r\n\r\n Q&nbsp; And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven\u2019t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you\u2019ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: All the above. It\u2019s a matter of timing.\n\r\n\r\n As you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents \u2014 better than me \u2014 have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing \u2014 order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done.\n\r\n\r\n The next major initiative is \u2014 and I\u2019ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail \u2014 is to rebuild the infrastructure \u2014 both physical and technological infrastructure in this country \u2014 so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.\n\r\n\r\n And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don\u2019t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure.\n\r\n\r\n I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide.\n\r\n\r\n Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what\u2019s the first thing that businesses asked? \u201cWhat\u2019s the closest access to \u2014 access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water \u2014 is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?\u201d All the things that relate to infrastructure.\n\r\n\r\n We have somewhere \u2014 I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did \u2014 not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure \u2014 we have \u2014 we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is.\n\r\n\r\n Bridges: More than one third of our bridges \u2014 231,000 of them \u2014 need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That\u2019s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights \u2014 20 percent of all flights weren\u2019t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane.\n\r\n\r\n What are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and \u2014 to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells.\n\r\n\r\n So, I \u2014 I just find it frustrated \u2014 frustrating to talk about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast point I\u2019ll make on the infrastructure \u2014 and I apologize for spending more time on it, but \u2014 is that if you think about it, it\u2019s the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can\u2019t build back to what they used to be. We have to build \u2014 the environment has \u2014 global warming has already done significant damage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe roads that used to be above the water level \u2014 didn\u2019t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was \u2014 now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it\u2019s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere\u2019s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re all from \u2014 how many schools where the kids can\u2019t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there\u2019s asbestos? How many schools in America we\u2019re sending our kids to don\u2019t have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can\u2019t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It\u2019s amazing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo there\u2019s so much we can do that\u2019s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I think that I got one more question here. Janet from Univision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP \u2014 had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. &nbsp;We have contacted the mother. That\u2019s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re already getting better, but they\u2019re going to get real \u2014 they\u2019ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we\u2019re going to hear of some people leaving, okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe can get this done. We\u2019re going to get it done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We\u2019re going to be moving, within the next \u2014 within the next week, over 100,000 \u2014 I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We\u2019re going to significantly ramp up. We\u2019re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of them doing other things \u2014 and move them into making those calls. We\u2019re in a \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I admire the fact that you were down there; you\u2019re making the calls yourself. It\u2019s real.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next thing that has to happen though \u2014 as you well know has to happen \u2014 there have to be some certitude that this is the \u2014 actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there\u2019s ways to do that. There\u2019s ways to do that \u2014 a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? \u201cWhat was your dog\u2019s name?\u201d kind of a thing. I\u2019m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to \u2014 to birth certificates, which takes longer.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; As you well know, treating the root cau- \u2014 causes in Latin America doesn\u2019t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I can\u2019t guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious \u2014 it\u2019s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala \u2014 I mean, in \u2014 in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying, \u201cI got a great idea. Let\u2019s sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don\u2019t speak the language. Won\u2019t that be fun? Let\u2019s go.\u201d That\u2019s not how it happens. People don\u2019t want to leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn\u2019t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it\u2019s much more heart wrenching \u2014 and it is \u2014 to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children \u2014 70 percent \u2014 are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn\u2019t make it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night \u2014 and there\u2019s some; that\u2019s true. That\u2019s why we got to act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd yesterday, I asked my team \u2014 both the director of the two agencies, as well as others \u2014 I asked them what would they, in fact \u2014 and I asked their opinion because they\u2019re the experts \u2014 but I said, \u201cFocus on the most vulnerable immediately.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there\u2019s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can\u2019t be made in the first 48 hours and begin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a \u2014 but I\u2019m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, folks, I\u2019m going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make \u2014 give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, on vaccinations: On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58 \u2014 42 days ahead of schedule.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, today, I\u2019m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people\u2019s arms. That\u2019s right: 200 million shots in 100 days.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know it\u2019s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close \u2014 not even close \u2014 to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd today, we\u2019ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities \u2014 as a consequence of the virus \u2014 by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders \u2014 a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we\u2019re really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we\u2019ll meet that goal as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people\u2019s bank accounts. That\u2019s real money in people\u2019s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority \u2014 a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that\u2019s going to take place this year. They\u2019re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent \u2014 a 6 percent growth in GDP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That\u2019s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZeke, the Associated Press.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I\u2019d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m going to \u2014 look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that\u2019s why I put all my focus in the beginning \u2014 there are a lot of problems \u2014 put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the other problems we\u2019re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they\u2019ve been around a long time. And what we\u2019re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and \u2014 whether it\u2019s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they\u2019re going to lose a family member, whether they\u2019re going to be in a position where they\u2019re not going to be \u2014 they\u2019re going to lose their home because they can\u2019t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to \u2014 to pay their rent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we\u2019re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that\u2019s the reason why I focused as I have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd here\u2019s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to \u2014 is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I\u2019m not going to do that; I\u2019m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And just to \u2014 to follow up, Mr. President, can your presidency be a success if you can\u2019t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that\u2019s going to be for the American people to decide.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI think \u2014 you know, I doubt whether \u2014 maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought \u2014 many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People\u2019s lives are changing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo let\u2019s see what happens. All I know, I\u2019ve been hired to solve problems \u2014 to solve problems, not create division.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. How about Yamiche?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thanks so much, Mr. President. You\u2019ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn\u2019t come to this country right now; this isn\u2019t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected \u2014 as a moral, decent man \u2014 is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won\u2019t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with \u2014 run by CPB [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I\u2019m the nice guy; that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s happening \u2014 that I\u2019m a decent man or however it\u2019s phrased. That \u2014 you know, that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming, because they know Biden is a good guy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came \u2014 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of \u2014 in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to that, there is a \u2014 and nobody \u2014 and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That\u2019s not the reason they\u2019re coming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason they\u2019re coming is that it\u2019s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they\u2019re coming because of the circumstances in-country \u2014 in-country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe way to deal with this problem \u2014 and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator \u2014 I mean, Vice President \u2014 putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn\u2019t use it. He didn\u2019t do it. And in addition to that, what he did \u2014 he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and \u2014 and has been \u2014 continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the \u2014 the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those \u2014 those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days \u2014 a little while. But he dismantled all of that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so what we\u2019re doing now is attempting to rebuild \u2014 rebuild the system that can accommodate the \u2014 what is happening today. And I like to think it\u2019s because I\u2019m a nice guy, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened every year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back \u2014 are being sent back. Thousands \u2014 tens of thousands of people who are \u2014 who are over 18 years of age and single \u2014 people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We\u2019re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. They\u2019re not getting across the border.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we\u2019re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We\u2019re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers\u2019 arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. Less than \u2014 I think it\u2019s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child \u2014 no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd today, I went to \u2014 for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and \u2014 and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss \u2014 5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo we\u2019re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It\u2019s going to take time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the other thing we\u2019re doing, I might add \u2014 am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don\u2019t want the details \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; (Inaudible.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I mean \u2014 I don\u2019t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I\u2019ll stop there and fin- \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; My follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families \u2014 why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. The families that are being allowed to stay, why they\u2019re being allowed to stay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there\u2019s \u2014 immigration is a big issue, of course, when it \u2014 related to the filibuster, but there\u2019s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJim Clyburn, someone who \u2014 of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I\u2019m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet\u2019s go to the first question you asked \u2014 the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not \u2014 some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They\u2019re saying they won\u2019t take them back \u2014 not all of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we\u2019re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we\u2019re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s an important point to understand \u2014 I know you understand; I don\u2019t mean to say it that way \u2014 an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States \u2014 a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we\u2019ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there\u2019s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They\u2019re establishing that right off the bat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says \u2014 to take the extreme case \u2014 \u201cI got a birth certificate.\u201d Then guess what? We\u2019re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so that\u2019s going to reduce significantly \u2014 there\u2019s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we\u2019re occupying now \u2014 both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss \u2014 to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that \u2014 it used to be required for the filibuster \u2014 and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them \u2014 that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 \u2014 the filibuster existed \u2014 there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it\u2019s being abused in a gigantic way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are \u2014 are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote \u2014 like the basic right to vote. We\u2019ve amended the filibuster in the past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut here\u2019s the deal: As you observed, I\u2019m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50-50 Senate, we\u2019ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, I\u2019m going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you \u2014 if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to \u2014 anyway \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI \u2014 we\u2019re going to get a lot done. And if we have to \u2014 if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what I\u2019m talking about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min \u2014 Ms. Kim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You\u2019re going to have to \u2014 the existing rule \u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it\u2019s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re going to do about the filibuster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; I\u2019d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old, Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Astounding.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; \u2014 and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That\u2019s why she sent him alone from Honduras.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging \u2014 in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process \u2014 encouraging families like Yossell says to come?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the idea that I\u2019m going to say \u2014 which I would never do \u2014 \u201cif an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we\u2019re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\u201d \u2014&nbsp;no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019m not going to do it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It\u2019s because of earthquakes, floods. It\u2019s because of lack of food. It\u2019s because of gang violence. It\u2019s because of a whole range of things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat \u2014 when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like \u2014 in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn\u2019t walk in the street because they were getting \u2014 their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, \u201cOkay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I\u2019ll put the lighting in.\u201d We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen this hurricane occurred \u2014 two hurricanes \u2014 instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn\u2019t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We\u2019re going to do a lot in our administration. We\u2019re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat mother did not sit around with \u2014 on the kitchen table and say, \u201cYou know, I got a great idea: The way I\u2019m going to make sure my son get taken care of is I\u2019m going to put a\u2026\u201d \u2014 how old was he, or she?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; He\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s nine. I also met a 10-year-old.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: A nine-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and he\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That\u2019s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in \u2014 I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, \u201cYou got to come home and take care of this.\u201d So we put together a plan and it had an impact.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, the question here is whether \u2014 how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There\u2019s no easy answer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; A quick follow, if I may. &nbsp;Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not \u2014 and in this young man\u2019s case, he has a mom at home; there\u2019s an overwhelming reason why he\u2019d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas \u2014 I was there \u2014 is at 1,556 percent capacity \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; \u2014 right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who say that they \u2014 some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What\u2019s your reaction \u2014 what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what\u2019s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Is \u2014 that\u2019s a serious question, right?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs it acceptable to me? Come on. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That\u2019s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely \u2014 not just children, but particularly children \u2014 to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what\u2019s happening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat is totally unacceptable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is that it\u2019s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it\u2019s hard to get those troops out. So, what we\u2019ve been doing \u2014 what I\u2019ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing \u2014 has been \u2014 we\u2019ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we\u2019re going to do so in a safe and orderly way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019re in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies, particularly those who have forces there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd General Austin is \u2014 just met with Ghani and I\u2019m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the \u2014 the \u201cleader,\u201d quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there\u2019s a U.N.-led process that\u2019s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people \u2014 how to end this war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it\u2019s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; You just said \u201cif we leave.\u201d Do you think it\u2019s possible that we\u2013<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: We will leave. The question is when we leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Do you \u2014 sorry \u2014 do you believe, though, it\u2019s possible we could have troops there next year?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I \u2014 I can\u2019t picture that being the case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Kristen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We\u2019ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven\u2019t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I will commit to transparency, and \u2014 as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd one of the reasons I haven\u2019t gone down \u2014 I have all my \u2014 my chief folks have gone down \u2014 is I don\u2019t want to become the issue. I don\u2019t want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t know, to be clear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that\u2019s happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I\u2019m sorry.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all \u2014 did not slow up the amount of immigration \u2014 and there\u2019s many people coming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd rolling back the policies of separating children from \u2014 from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and \u2014 I make no apologies for that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested \u2014 number one. We\u2019re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses \u2014 if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now: consulting with our allies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Just a very quick follow-up \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: You\u2019ve only got another hour now, okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ &nbsp;Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters \u2014 the very people who helped to get you elected in November.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you worried that if you don\u2019t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: What I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at five o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\u2019s all designed \u2014 and I\u2019m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in \u2014 outside this White House. I\u2019m not talking about the elected officials; I\u2019m talking about voters. Voters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so I am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they\u2019re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from \u2014 from becoming the law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: The answer is \u201cyes,\u201d but I\u2019m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven\u2019t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) My predecessor need do [sic] \u2014 needed to. My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Have you \u2014 have you \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d My plan is to run for reelection. That\u2019s my expectation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And then, on \u2014 on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, I haven\u2019t at all. I\u2019ve been meeting \u2014 when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work \u2014 we\u2019re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we\u2019re working together on a bunch of things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that \u2014 I would like Republican \u2014 elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I\u2019m doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is \u2014 the last piece of legislation is so far left \u2014 well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOkay. Where am I here? Let me see. Kaitlan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I\u2019d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that\u2019s on the filibuster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: That counts as a question, but go ahead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Okay. I\u2019ll make it quick. It\u2019s a quick question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no \u2014 you can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis\u2019s funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a \u201crelic\u201d of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And if not, why not abolish it if it\u2019s a relic of the Jim Crow era?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It\u2019s been abused from the time it came into being \u2014 by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let\u2019s deal with the abuse first.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; It sounds like you\u2019re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I answered your question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I said, \u201cThat is my expectation.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; So is that a \u201cyes\u201d that you are running for reelection?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Look, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you guys come from, man. I\u2019ve never been able to travel. I\u2019m a great respecter of fate. I\u2019ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And if you do \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: It \u2014<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: I would fully expect that to be the case. She\u2019s doing a great job. She\u2019s a great partner. She\u2019s a great partner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; And do you believe you\u2019ll be running against former President Trump?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. I don\u2019t even think about \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don\u2019t have to answer my question, but, I mean, you know, do you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI mean, look, this is \u2014 the way I view things \u2014 I\u2019ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that\u2019s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hardworking, decent American people who are getting \u2014 really having it stuck to them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you notice \u2014 don\u2019t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had \u2014 if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it \u2014 in dealing with the \u2014 the act that we just passed which puts money in people\u2019s pockets \u2014 ordinary people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDid you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut \u2014 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they\u2019ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It\u2019s kind of amazing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the federal budget is saving people\u2019s lives, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans \u2014 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you\u2019re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is \u2014 something is wrong. Their newfound concern.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m concerned \u2014 look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I\u2019m wrong, and I respect that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country \u2014 the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.\u201d The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I\u2019ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, from my perspective, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 to me, it\u2019s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people \u2014 just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have \u2014 make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether \u2014 since he didn\u2019t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I\u2019m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that \u2014 that same \u2014 that same view, that same sense of what is \u2014 you know, what\u2019s appropriate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJustin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you\u2019ve been in office for a couple months. There\u2019s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there\u2019s the continued human rights abuses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, today, I\u2019m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, look, they\u2019re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter \u2014 my interpreter and his \u2014 going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn\u2019t have a democratic \u2014 with a small \u201cD\u201d \u2014 bone in his body. But he\u2019s a smart, smart guy. He\u2019s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can\u2019t function in an ever \u2014 an ever-complex world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were \u2014 his people were on call as well as mine, listening \u2014 we had a two-hour conversation. For two hours.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I\u2019ve told him in person on several occasions: that we\u2019re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo, that we\u2019ll have strong competition but we\u2019ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we\u2019re going to deal with China effectively, and we\u2019re going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we\u2019re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we\u2019re \u2014 and I\u2019m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the \u201860s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it\u2019s 0.7 percent. I\u2019m going to change that. We\u2019re going to change that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I\u2019m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the reasons why I\u2019ve set up the \u2014 the&nbsp;PAB&nbsp;[PCAST] \u2014 the President\u2019s board with scientists and the like, again \u2014 is we\u2019re going to invest in medical research \u2014 cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, the things \u2014 industries of the future \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we\u2019re going to make real investments. China is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe third \u2014 the second thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to reestablish our alliances. And I\u2019ve been very clear with him, it\u2019s not anti-Chinese. And we\u2019ve talked about it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this \u2014 as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we\u2019ve been going close to an hour. I\u2019m happy to go longer. But one of the things that I\u2019m going to be doing, I\u2019m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly \u2014 I think within the next hour or so. I don\u2019t know the exact time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd earlier this month \u2014 and apparently it got the Chinese\u2019s attention; that\u2019s not why I did it \u2014 I met with our allies and how we\u2019re going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States \u2014 the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore too long, I\u2019m going to have \u2014 I\u2019m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we\u2019re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules \u2014 to follow the rules \u2014 whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands \u2014 he makes no pretense about not understanding what I\u2019m saying any more than I do him \u2014 I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as \u2014 \u201cAnd, Mr. President, as I\u2019ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don\u2019t always live up to our expectations, but it\u2019s a values system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we\u2019re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear \u2014 make it clear what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President \u2014 at least one did \u2014 but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what\u2019s happening to the Uighurs, what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong, what\u2019s happening in-country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2019s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It\u2019s who we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don\u2019t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That\u2019s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q&nbsp; All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that\u2019s not where I make the decision; that\u2019s where I make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look around the world. We\u2019re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped \u2014 because all the people get to speak \u2014 to compete?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear, absolutely clear \u2014 and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country \u2014 that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you notice, you don\u2019t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It\u2019s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. We\u2019ve got to prove democracy works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q&nbsp; And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven\u2019t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you\u2019ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: All the above. It\u2019s a matter of timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents \u2014 better than me \u2014 have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing \u2014 order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next major initiative is \u2014 and I\u2019ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail \u2014 is to rebuild the infrastructure \u2014 both physical and technological infrastructure in this country \u2014 so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don\u2019t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what\u2019s the first thing that businesses asked? \u201cWhat\u2019s the closest access to \u2014 access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water \u2014 is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?\u201d All the things that relate to infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have somewhere \u2014 I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did \u2014 not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure \u2014 we have \u2014 we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bridges: More than one third of our bridges \u2014 231,000 of them \u2014 need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That\u2019s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights \u2014 20 percent of all flights weren\u2019t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and \u2014 to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I \u2014 I just find it frustrated \u2014 frustrating to talk about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast point I\u2019ll make on the infrastructure \u2014 and I apologize for spending more time on it, but \u2014 is that if you think about it, it\u2019s the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can\u2019t build back to what they used to be. We have to build \u2014 the environment has \u2014 global warming has already done significant damage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe roads that used to be above the water level \u2014 didn\u2019t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was \u2014 now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it\u2019s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere\u2019s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re all from \u2014 how many schools where the kids can\u2019t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there\u2019s asbestos? How many schools in America we\u2019re sending our kids to don\u2019t have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can\u2019t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It\u2019s amazing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo there\u2019s so much we can do that\u2019s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd I think that I got one more question here. Janet from Univision.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP \u2014 had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. &nbsp;We have contacted the mother. That\u2019s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re already getting better, but they\u2019re going to get real \u2014 they\u2019ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we\u2019re going to hear of some people leaving, okay?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe can get this done. We\u2019re going to get it done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We\u2019re going to be moving, within the next \u2014 within the next week, over 100,000 \u2014 I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We\u2019re going to significantly ramp up. We\u2019re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of them doing other things \u2014 and move them into making those calls. We\u2019re in a \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut I admire the fact that you were down there; you\u2019re making the calls yourself. It\u2019s real.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next thing that has to happen though \u2014 as you well know has to happen \u2014 there have to be some certitude that this is the \u2014 actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there\u2019s ways to do that. There\u2019s ways to do that \u2014 a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? \u201cWhat was your dog\u2019s name?\u201d kind of a thing. I\u2019m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to \u2014 to birth certificates, which takes longer.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; As you well know, treating the root cau- \u2014 causes in Latin America doesn\u2019t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I can\u2019t guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious \u2014 it\u2019s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala \u2014 I mean, in \u2014 in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying, \u201cI got a great idea. Let\u2019s sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don\u2019t speak the language. Won\u2019t that be fun? Let\u2019s go.\u201d That\u2019s not how it happens. People don\u2019t want to leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn\u2019t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it\u2019s much more heart wrenching \u2014 and it is \u2014 to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children \u2014 70 percent \u2014 are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn\u2019t make it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night \u2014 and there\u2019s some; that\u2019s true. That\u2019s why we got to act.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd yesterday, I asked my team \u2014 both the director of the two agencies, as well as others \u2014 I asked them what would they, in fact \u2014 and I asked their opinion because they\u2019re the experts \u2014 but I said, \u201cFocus on the most vulnerable immediately.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there\u2019s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can\u2019t be made in the first 48 hours and begin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ&nbsp; If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a \u2014 but I\u2019m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, folks, I\u2019m going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Biden_First_Press_Conference.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Joe Biden holds the first press conference of his presidency.
