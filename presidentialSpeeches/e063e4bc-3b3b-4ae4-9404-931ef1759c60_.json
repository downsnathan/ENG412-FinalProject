Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n America is, and must always be, a nation of law and order. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And to those who broke the law, you will pay.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n We have just been through an intense election, and emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and the eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections.\n\r\n\r\n Now Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n 2020 has been a challenging time for our people. A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millions in their homes, damaged our economy, and claimed countless lives. Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth will require all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family. We must revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n To the citizens of our country, serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime. And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.&nbsp;", "transcript_html": "<p>I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol.

He denounces the violence and lawlessness of the attack on American democracy and urges Americans to come together in healing and reconciliation. This speech has a very different tone&nbsp;than the one that President Trump released the previous day when he told the intruders that he loved them and thought they were very special.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"}
