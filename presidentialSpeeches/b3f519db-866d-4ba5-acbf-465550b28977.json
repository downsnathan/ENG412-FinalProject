    "introduction": "<p>President Hayes sends federal troops to protect mail and quell the riots that take place in numerous cities as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877.&nbsp; Following pay cuts, the strike begins on the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) line at Camden Junction, Maryland; additional strikes will follow, lasting a month. Lacking organization, the strikes frequently degenerate into mob activity. The strike will lead to anti-Chinese attacks in San Francisco during the fall.</p>\r\n"
