Thank you. Happy Labor Day. That was, really, a very special time I had speaking to some of the labor union heads and other people. They\u2019re very happy with the way things are going. As you probably see, the numbers are terrific.\n\r\n\r\n So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they\u2019re doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It\u2019s why I thought we\u2019d do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place.\n\r\n\r\n The United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we\u2019re doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we\u2019re rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic.\n\r\n\r\n The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, and we\u2019ve have added a record-setting 10.6 million jobs since May. 10.6 million jobs since May. That\u2019s a record that is not even close. Second place is a long ways away.\n\r\n\r\n In July, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections, where you\u2019d go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead, the unemployment rate plunged, really, to the surprise of many, all the way down to 8.4 percent in August. And that\u2019s the second-largest single month decline on record. And we have the first; we have both of them. So we have the two number-one declines\u2014\u201cdecline\u201d meaning positive, not negative.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history\u2014world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small\u2014very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery.\n\r\n\r\n Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, I project. And some people are starting to agree. We have a \u201cV\u201d shape. It\u2019s probably a \u201csuper V.\u201d And you see what\u2019s going on with the stock market, where it\u2019s, in certain cases, already setting records. NASDAQ: has set 17 records already, and this is as we\u2019re, hopefully, rounding the final turn in the pandemic.\n\r\n\r\n First, we\u2019ll end the pandemic. Under Operation Warp Speed, we\u2019ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April. You don\u2019t hear that from the press very often. They don\u2019t like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85 percent\u2014think of that\u2014since April.\n\r\n\r\n The United States has experienced among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And we are an absolute leader in every way. Under my leadership, we\u2019ll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate\u2014the most liberal person in Congress, by the way, who\u2019s not a competent person, in my opinion; would destroy this country and would destroy this economy\u2014should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science.\n\r\n\r\n And what\u2019s happening is, all of a sudden, you\u2019ll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric\u2014it\u2019s a politic rhetoric; that\u2019s all it is. Just for politics. Because now they see we\u2019ve done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before. This could\u2019ve taken two or three years, and instead it\u2019s going to be\u2014it\u2019s going to be done in a very short of period of time. Could even have it during the month of October.\n\r\n\r\n So, contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine that they\u2019re\u2014they politicalize. They\u2019ll say anything. And it\u2019s so dangerous for our country, what they say. But the vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will be delivered very soon. You could\u2014you could have a very big surprise coming up. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very happy. But the people will be happy. The people of the world will be happy.\n\r\n\r\n Next, we\u2019ll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro-American policies. We\u2019ll pass new tax cuts to boost take-home pay. We\u2019re going to be cutting taxes very substantially. We get it back through growth. We had tremendous growth until we got hit with the China virus.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign. We\u2019ve\u2014as you know, in three and a half years, we\u2019ve cut more regulations than any other administration, no matter how long, no matter what period of time you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll enact fair trade deals, and we\u2019re working on seven major fair trade deals right now. And when I say \u201cfair,\u201d fair to our country\u2014because our country was ripped off by every nation. Friend, foe, didn\u2019t matter: Every nation was ripping us off at a level that it\u2019s just unbelievable, to be honest.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re going to be expanding Opportunity Zones, and we will keep that going. It\u2019s been a tremendous\u2014a tremendous program. I want to thank Senator Scott, South Carolina, for coming up with that whole concept, because he came up, and I liked it right away, and it was\u2014it\u2019s really turned out to be a tremendous thing, especially for African Americans, Hispanic Americans.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ll continue to unleash American energy. We\u2019re number one in the world. And we\u2019re totally energy independent right now. And in 2021, we\u2019ll create 10 million jobs, at least, in the first 10 months.\n\r\n\r\n Joe Biden and the radical, socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in, they would collapse it. You\u2019ll have a crash the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s\u2014remember, it\u2019s the people that own these massive, listed companies. A lot of people: rich people and not so rich people and middle-income people. And those stocks will crash like you\u2019ve never seen before.\n\r\n\r\n The Biden plan begins with a 4-trillion-dollar tax hike. And that will end everything, including growth. There won\u2019t be growth. There\u2019ll be total contraction.\n\r\n\r\n Biden has also pledged to demolish the U.S. energy industry and implement the same policies causing blackouts in California. He wants to have things lit up with wind. He\u2019ll have to talk to China, Russia, India, and lots of other countries, because they\u2019re not doing that. And if they\u2019re not doing it, it puts us at a tremendous economic disadvantage, and it doesn\u2019t work.\n\r\n\r\n You take a look at the blackouts in California; it\u2019s really rather amazing what\u2019s going on there. They\u2019ve tried to go, and that\u2019s just with a small portion going that route. That doesn\u2019t work, and it can\u2019t fire up our big plants. We\u2019re going to have this great industry that we\u2019ve created. Can\u2019t fire up our big plants.\n\r\n\r\n Biden\u2019s plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire U.S. economy. He\u2019s going to totally rely on somebody to walk up, \u201cYes, sir, it\u2019s time to shut it down.\u201d He\u2019d be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease, and other very serious illnesses.\n\r\n\r\n Because when you do a shutdown, there\u2019s a problem on the other side; it\u2019s not just from the virus. You have a big problem with suicides, with losing your jobs, with all sorts of things. You just take a look. Depression is a massive problem. And what happens is you\u2014they turn to substance abuse, alcohol, drugs. So we can\u2019t do that. And then we\u2019d have to give up all of the gains that I\u2019ve been talking about over the last three months. We\u2019ve\u2014what we have done is incredible. We\u2019re setting records. All over the world, no matter where you go, nobody has done what we\u2019ve been able to do.\n\r\n\r\n So we\u2019re setting records in jobs. We\u2019re setting records in numbers. And you\u2019re going to see some very big numbers. Third-quarter numbers are coming out right before a very special day, November 3rd. So you have the numbers coming out, and they\u2019re, I think, going to be fantastic. You know, I think they\u2019re going to be fantastic.\n\r\n\r\n The best numbers of all, if somebody doesn\u2019t come along and raise taxes\u2014double, triple, quadruple your taxes\u2014will be the numbers from next year. But you\u2019re going to have a good third-quarter number coming out. And I think it\u2019s going to be hard for even the media to disparage that number.\n\r\n\r\n Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus, he wants to surrender our families to the violent left-wing mob, and he wants to surrender our jobs to China\u2014our jobs and our economic wellbeing. I\u2019ve taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. No other President has done what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve given much of it to the farmers. I\u2019ve given it to farmers and manufacturers, but I\u2019ve given most of it to the U.S. Treasury. Nobody has done that. We haven\u2019t taken in 10 cents from China ever.\n\r\n\r\n They targeted our farmers, and I targeted them. And I gave $28 billion to our farmers. Our farmers wouldn\u2019t be existent right now. Right now, they\u2019re very happy. In fact, they\u2019re setting records on purchases. China is purchasing more corn than they\u2019ve ever done. Record purchase of corn and soybeans, beef\u2014because they know I\u2019m not happy with them. They know I\u2019m not happy at all.\n\r\n\r\n And, frankly, I don\u2019t want to set the world necessarily to thinking too much about it right now, but there\u2019s been no country anywhere, at any time, that\u2019s ripped us off like China has. We lose billions and billions of dollars for years and years, decades. We\u2019ve lost billions and billions and billions of dollars by dealing with China. We get nothing from China. They get nothing, other than loss, other than giving our money. And they take that money, and they build their military. And you see they\u2019re building up a powerful military. And it\u2019s very lucky that I\u2019ve been building our up, because otherwise we\u2019d be dwarfed right now by China. We would be a terrible thing. A terrible thing.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re way ahead on the nuclear front. We\u2019ve upgraded our nuclear. Hope to God we never have to use it. But we would be in a position that we are not in right now. But China is spending the money we give them to build up their military. So when you mention the world \u201cdecouple,\u201d it\u2019s an interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars, and if we didn\u2019t do business with them, we wouldn\u2019t lose billions of dollars. It\u2019s called \u201cdecoupling.\u201d So you\u2019ll start thinking about it. You\u2019ll start thinking.\n\r\n\r\n They take our money, and they spend it on building airplanes and building ships and building rockets and missiles. And Biden has been just a pawn for them. He\u2019s been so easy. They dream about Biden. There was a report today that they hope that Joe Biden becomes President. If Joe Biden becomes President, China will own the United States, and every other country will be smiling also. They\u2019ll be smiling.\n\r\n\r\n When reports come out that certain countries don\u2019t really like me too much, that\u2019s not because of my personality, although it could be that also, frankly. It\u2019s because of the fact that I\u2019ve been very tough on countries that have been ripping us off for so many years.\n\r\n\r\n If you look at NATO, with the exception of eight countries\u2014we\u2019re one of them\u2014every country is way behind. They\u2019re delinquent, especially Germany, in paying their NATO bills. That means we end up paying it, and we\u2019re not doing it. I told them; we\u2019re not doing it. And they\u2019ve increased their spending now $130 billion, going up to $400 billion a year. It\u2019s all because of me. Then you hear the country doesn\u2019t like me. I mean, I can understand that, because President Obama and other presidents, in all fairness, would go in there and they\u2019d make a speech and they\u2019d leave. I went in there, I looked, and I said, \u201cThis is unfair. We\u2019re paying for NATO.\u201d We\u2019re paying for NATO. Almost all of it.\n\r\n\r\n So they rip us off on the military and then they rip us off, with the European Union, on trade. And Biden doesn\u2019t have a clue. You know he doesn\u2019t have a clue. Everybody knows he doesn\u2019t have a clue. In primetime, he wasn\u2019t good. And now it\u2019s not primetime.\n\r\n\r\n He spent 47 years sending American jobs to China, to Mexico, and to other countries, while collecting millions of dollars in campaign and super PAC contributions from global corporations that got rich by making American workers poor.\n\r\n\r\n His son, \u201cWhere is Hunter?\u201d\u2014Where is Hunter?\u2014I call him \u201cWhere is Hunter?\u201d\u2014walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, even though he never did that before. He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine, from China, and from other countries. Between his son and his brother, you ought to read the statements. And the press doesn\u2019t pick that up. If I ever did that, it would be\u2014it would be hell, even worse than it\u2019s been. Okay? Even worse than it\u2019s been.\n\r\n\r\n What he\u2019s done is so incredible. \u201cI won\u2019t give them the billion dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t give them, unless they get rid of that prosecutor.\u201d And then, voila, they got rid of the prosecutor. And the press doesn\u2019t even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he\u2019s right on tape, and you don\u2019t want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves.\n\r\n\r\n But Biden shipped away our jobs, threw open our borders, and sent our youth to fight in these crazy endless wars. And it\u2019s one of the reasons the military\u2014I\u2019m not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren\u2019t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.\n\r\n\r\n But we\u2019re getting out of the endless wars; you know how we\u2019re we doing. We defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate\u2014100 percent. When I was in\u2014when I came in, it was a mess; it was all over. They have it, in a certain color, all ISIS. A year later, I said, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all gone, sir. Because of you, it\u2019s all gone,\u201d because of my philosophy. But all gone. And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Let\u2019s bring our soldiers back home. Some people don\u2019t like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money.\u201d One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another, and that\u2019s what it was.\n\r\n\r\n Biden supported NAFTA. He supported China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. Two disasters. The most disastrous trade deals in history, both of them. I can\u2019t tell you which was worse; they were both terrible.\n\r\n\r\n And as you know, I ended it, and I ended NAFTA. And we\u2019re looking at the World Trade Organization. They\u2019ve become much better\u2014I will say that. We\u2014World Health, I got out of because we\u2019re spending $500 million. China was spending $38 million, and China controlled it. But World Trade, we\u2019re looking at it. They\u2019ve been very nice to us lately, I will say that\u2014amazingly. We never used to win anything at the World Trade; would lose every case. Now, all of a sudden, we\u2019re winning a lot of cases. We just won $7 billion as a case. And they\u2019re talking to us much differently than they used to, because if they don\u2019t shape up, we\u2019re going to ship out. That\u2019s all. We\u2019re not treated fairly.\n\r\n\r\n China is treated as a developing nation. Developing nation. We\u2019re treated as a nation that\u2019s fully developed. We\u2019re not fully developed, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2014when you look around at Portland and you see what these Democrats are doing to our cities. Take a look at what\u2019s happening in New York and Chicago, where you have Democrat-run cities and mayors that are running, and governors that are running states so badly, and mayors running cities so badly. It\u2019s very sad to look at it. It\u2019s Democrat-run, every one of them that I see. I guess we could probably find one or two that aren\u2019t. But I don\u2019t\u2014so far, I haven\u2019t been able to.\n\r\n\r\n If you look at Biden, he supported TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a disaster; it would have destroyed our automobile business. By the way, many plants are being built right now\u2014auto plants\u2014in Michigan, just like I said. They\u2019re being built in Ohio; they\u2019re being built in South Carolina, North Carolina. They\u2019re being built all over and expanded at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before, because I said to Japan and Germany and others: \u201cSorry, you got to come here and build plants. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n And we got out of the horrible Paris Climate Accord that he\u2019ll go back into because, you know, it sounds wonderful. It\u2019s a disaster for this country. They\u2019ve basically taken away your wealth, the Paris Climate Accord. And the other countries don\u2019t have to adhere to it. China doesn\u2019t kick in until 2030; they don\u2019t have to do anything until 2030. We had very high standards. We would have had to close, under some scenarios, 25 percent of our businesses in order to qualify under this ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. It sounds good. It was very bad, very expensive.\n\r\n\r\n The New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden\u2019s China sell-outs, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that. In 2001, Biden said, \u201cThe United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous, integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules.\u201d They didn\u2019t play by the rules. They didn\u2019t play by the rules.\n\r\n\r\n The World Trade Organization, one of the reasons it\u2019s so bad is that China didn\u2019t play by the rules. We did. We did. But their rules were easier because they\u2019re considered a developing nation, so they had a much lower standard. But even that, they didn\u2019t play by the rules. That\u2019s when they became a rocket ship. They were flat-lined for years and years and years. Then they joined the World Trade Organization. And, frankly, they cheated. Okay? They cheated. I\u2019ll say it. What difference does it make? I feel much differently. I feel I made a great trade deal with China. Great. And they\u2019re buying. You know why they\u2019re buying? Because they know I\u2019m not happy. That\u2019s why they\u2019re buying. And I talk about it because today is Labor Day, and it\u2019s a good to time talk about when we\u2019re being ripped off by countries. But nobody is even close to China.\n\r\n\r\n Biden cheered China\u2019s rise as a great power \u201cbecause great powers adhere to international norms in the areas of nonproliferation, human rights, and trade.\u201d Well, they didn\u2019t. They took advantage of stupid people. Stupid people. And Biden is a stupid person. You know that. You\u2019re not going to write it. But you know that.\n\r\n\r\n The cost of Biden\u2019s economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories. And I heard this morning the real number is probably 70,000\u201470,000 shuttered American factories. And he\u2019s talking about how wonderful it is with China. No, China has been very bad, on top of which we had the China plague sent to us and other viruses\u2014nothing near this serious\u2014but the swine, and we had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why.\n\r\n\r\n If Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country. If Biden wins, China will own this country, and hopefully you\u2019re not going to be able to find that out. It\u2019s the most important election in our history, right now. Most important election in our history.\n\r\n\r\n Under my administration, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we\u2019ll end our reliance on China once and for all. Whether it\u2019s decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I\u2019ve been doing already, we\u2019re going to end our reliance on China because we can\u2019t rely on China. And I don\u2019t want them building a military like they\u2019re building right now, and they\u2019re using our money to build it.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ll manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States. We\u2019ll create \u201cMade in America\u201d tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States. And we\u2019ll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries. If they can\u2019t do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country. We\u2019ll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China. And we\u2019ll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world.\n\r\n\r\n Now you can understand why China would much rather see Sleepy Joe than Donald Trump. But as long as I\u2019m President, we will never waver in our undying loyalty to the American worker and to our country as a whole.\n\r\n\r\n So, Happy Labor Day, everybody. Yeah. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thanks, Mr. President. The issue of what happened when you were in France continues to be a story.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re going to have to take that off, please. Just\u2014you can take it off. Your health\u2014how many feet are you away?\n\r\n\r\n Q: I\u2019ll speak a lot louder.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you don\u2019t take it off, you\u2019re very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.\n\r\n\r\n Q: I\u2019ll just speak a lot louder. Is that better?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s better, yeah. It\u2019s better.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, some people are having a hard time believing your denials of the Atlantic story because of what you said about John McCain in the past. Do you understand that? And have you asked John Kelly \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t understand that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And have you asked John Kelly to refute that story?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t understand it at all, no, because I\u2019ve always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we\u2019re going to win them. And, frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that\u2019s been very obvious. I was\u2014but I had to approve his entire\u2014his funeral. I wanted him to get\u2014he deserved a first-class\u2014you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket\u2014a lot of things.\n\r\n\r\n But, no, I was never a fan of John McCain because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn\u2019t. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of\u2014our great vets\u2014was not good, not appropriate. And, of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody\u2014am I supposed to say, \u201cWhat a wonderful guy\u201d?\n\r\n\r\n So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it\u2019s turned out to be right. But I wasn\u2019t a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn\u2019t agree with him on a lot of things.\n\r\n\r\n The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself\u2014which I don\u2019t read, but I hear it\u2019s just totally anti-Trump; he\u2019s a big Obama person, he\u2019s a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It\u2019s a totally made-up story.\n\r\n\r\n In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s\u2014I think that\u2019s number 15\u2014and these are people that were there. That\u2019s the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it\u2019s not true. He just came out.\n\r\n\r\n And it\u2019s a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There\u2019s nobody\u2014and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.\n\r\n\r\n But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn\u2019t hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue.\n\r\n\r\n Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I\u2019ve just about ever seen. And it was a fog you\u2014you literally couldn\u2019t see. I walked out, and I didn\u2019t have\u2014I didn\u2019t need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can take helicopters in this.\u201d I understand helicopters very well. And they said, \u201cNo, sir, that\u2019s been cancelled.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n They would have had to go\u2014Secret Service, I have the whole list\u2014they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do it,\u201d because they\u2019re not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that.\n\r\n\r\n I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for two hours, three hours, four hours. I didn\u2019t care. It didn\u2019t matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, \u201cSir, we can\u2019t allow you to make this trip.\u201d If I wanted to: \u201cSir, we can\u2019t allow you, from a safety standpoint.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier\u2014the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there\u2019ll be more phony stories.\n\r\n\r\n But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that\u2019s denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he\u2019s probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that\u2019s enough of that.\n\r\n\r\n Yes, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you. Christina Bobb, One America News. Thank you for holding the briefing.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n Q: We\u2019re seeing judges, most recently in Detroit, limit police ability to use non-lethal force. My first question would be: Should the police be allowed to use non-lethal force to quell the violence in their cities?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re talking about where? Non-lethal force?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Right. So in the riots, most recently \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: The riots?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think what\u2019s happened is the\u2014the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there\u2019s no\u2014there\u2019s no retribution. There\u2019s no\u2014they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen.\n\r\n\r\n But I\u2019ve told, when we have the federal in there\u2014as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a\u2014another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After two and a half days, they didn\u2019t arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren\u2019t playing games. They can\u2019t play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there\u2019s got to be a form of retribution.\n\r\n\r\n I watch\u2014so often, when I watch some of the areas that we\u2019re talking about\u2014now we have Rochester\u2014that\u2019s, again, Democrat governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be.\n\r\n\r\n I was with the governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how they allow this to happen.\u201d And, you know, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different. I could talk about other governors saying the same thing.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please, go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: If I could follow up on that. We\u2019re also hearing reports of groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter traveling around the country, leaving their home cities to go riot and protest in other cities where they\u2019re causing damage.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Do we expect to see prosecution or charges \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q\u2014from the Department of Justice for those traveling for that purpose?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: So we have now over 1,000 people\u2014federal\u2014in jail. We\u2019re prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was three months ago. There hasn\u2019t been a federal monument knocked down in three months, or even thought about. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even thought about it. So that\u2019s had a very big impact\u2014a very big impact.\n\r\n\r\n But, yeah, we\u2019re going around, and the nice part is you people take\u2014see those people up there?\u2014they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don\u2019t even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it.\n\r\n\r\n But right after that, I signed a\u2014an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They\u2019ve\u2014they\u2019ve got plenty of ideas. They\u2019re not at want for ideas.\n\r\n\r\n Please, go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. Spunt\u2014David Spunt from Fox News. Mr. Trump\u2014Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. Sir, you talked a lot about the economy and touted the economy. Three weeks ago, in Bedminster, I asked you specifically why you have not called Democratic leadership in the White House to meet with them. If they don\u2019t want to meet, it\u2019s on them.\n\r\n\r\n A lot of people are criticizing you. I cover you on the weekends and stuff. You\u2019re \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think they are.\n\r\n\r\n Q\u2014doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: I mean, we\u2019re in September. There is no deal. There is no hope of a deal.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I know. I know.\n\r\n\r\n Q: We\u2019re two months out from the election. What do you say to \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Don\u2019t say there\u2019s \u201cno hope.\u201d Why do you say there\u2019s \u201cno hope\u201d?\n\r\n\r\n Q: But what can you say to the millions \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: What do you know?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Well, what can you say\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: What do you know?\n\r\n\r\n Q: It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s hope, sir.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And let me just tell you: I know my customers; that\u2019s what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don\u2019t want to make a deal because they think it\u2019s good for politics if they don\u2019t make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you\u2019re dealing with. I do. These are people that I don\u2019t have a lot of respect. I don\u2019t think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I\u2019m dealing with.\n\r\n\r\n And I don\u2019t need to meet with them to be turned down. They don\u2019t want to make a deal because they know that\u2019s good for the economy. And if they make a deal that\u2019s good for the economy, and therefore it\u2019s good for me for the election in November\u2014November 3rd, and therefore they\u2019re not going to make a deal.\n\r\n\r\n Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want\u2014they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and states. Whether it\u2019s New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out.\u201d We\u2019ll do something to help cities, but that\u2019s going to have to rest on its own.\n\r\n\r\n And why didn\u2019t you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I\u2019m dealing with.\n\r\n\r\n And I\u2019m on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they\u2019re there. But I also know when it\u2019s time to meet with people. I\u2019ve done very well with deals, okay? That\u2019s what I do. And I know when it\u2019s time to meet. But I don\u2019t have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks\u2014which is the microphones\u2014and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office.\n\r\n\r\n So they don\u2019t want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that\u2019s good for the Democrats. But, David, that\u2019s a bad thing.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But as President, shouldn\u2019t you take the high road, sir?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I am taking the high road. I\u2019m taking the high road by not seeing them. That\u2019s the high road.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President. David \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I\u2019d do it in a minute.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah, David Jackson, USA Today. My question is about the Durham report, which you have talked about recently. You said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Now, you\u2019ve accused people of committing crimes against you during the Russia investigation \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Sure. Sure.\n\r\n\r\n Q: \u2013including President Obama and Joe Biden.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: They spied on my campaign. That\u2019s right.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Because my question is \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail two years ago. They would have been in jail\u2014literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail two years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But excuse me, my question is: Do you want the Justice Department to indict people over this?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven\u2019t seen\u2014I purposely\u2014I don\u2019t know if that was a good thing, smart thing. I don\u2019t know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved, and maybe someday I\u2019ll get involved in it.\n\r\n\r\n They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake\u2014written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats\u2014and they used that illegally in the FISA courts.\n\r\n\r\n If we did what they did, you would have many people in jail all right\u2014right now. And you have, other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents\u2014we don\u2019t have that yet, but the report hasn\u2019t been issued yet. Let\u2019s see what happens.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It sure sounds like you want to prosecute people.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: But let me just\u2014let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden\u2014Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let\u2019s see what happens.\n\r\n\r\n But if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least\u2014it would have started two years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s never\u2014and nothing like that\u2019s ever happened before. Then they created, at tremendous expense\u2014the money they paid is tremendous; I\u2019m sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier\u2014a fake dossier\u2014proven to be, now, fake. Everyone\u2014and they used it in the FISA courts. That\u2019s a crime.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But it sure sounds like you want to prosecute \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: So far, I haven\u2019t seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn\u2019t been issued yet. Let\u2019s see what happens with the Durham report.\n\r\n\r\n But this started at Obama, and some people would say\u2014and some people, \u201cWell, but he was President,\u201d like, \u201cLet\u2019s leave him alone.\u201d If it were me, they wouldn\u2019t be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It\u2019s a totally double standard, and it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a disgrace.\n\r\n\r\n And if I were a Republican senator and if I were a Republican congressman\u2014and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don\u2019t fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot\u2014they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they\u2019re dirty fighters.\n\r\n\r\n And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They\u2019re not requested; they\u2019re just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, non-requested. I call them \u201cunsolicited ballots.\u201d That\u2019s going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they\u2019re going to say, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d And then they\u2019re going to harvest. They\u2019re going to do all the things.\n\r\n\r\n And if you look at the last period of six months\u2014take a look at the races where they\u2019ve sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what\u2019s happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It\u2019s a disgrace. That\u2019ll be a beauty.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President. If proven true, are you okay with Postmaster General DeJoy and the fact that he asked former employees at his private company to make donations to the GOP and then reimburse them? Are you okay with that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don\u2019t\u2014other than that, I\u2019d have to see it. He\u2019s a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of a\u2014an approval that took place by both parties. I don\u2019t know exactly what the story is. I\u2019ll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time\u2014I read it this morning, just like you did.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Would you support an investigation, sir?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Sure.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And in \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I think let the investigations go. But\u2014but he\u2019s a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we\u2019ll see how that goes. But, no, I think he\u2019s a very honest guy, but we\u2019ll see.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: He\u2019s proven to be a campaign \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, just a follow-up, please, if you don\u2019t mind. If it\u2019s proven to be a campaign finance scheme, do you think he should lose his job?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Always. They\u2019ve been looking at me for four years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For four years\u2014from the day I came down the escalator, I\u2019ve been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, \u201cYou have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the Office of President.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Think of it: They spent\u2014just Mueller alone, he spent\u2014I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was\u2014many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every\u2014and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said\u2014sophisticated friends have said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of truth to that.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President. After Navalny poisoning, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under pressure to cancel Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. Would you support such a move?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Sure.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Do you think that the project should be canceled?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Well, I\u2019ve been support-\u2014I\u2019ve been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along.\n\r\n\r\n When I came along, I said, \u201cWait a minute. We\u2019re protecting Germany from Russia, right?\u201d NATO. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy.\u201d And the real number is probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the\u2014what we\u2019ve done for Ukraine, relative to what the past\u2014they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected.\n\r\n\r\n And I said, \u201cWhy is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we\u2019re protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?\u201d And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent because they\u2019re only paying a little more than 1 percent and they\u2019re supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump\u2014me\u2014I got the countries of NATO to spend one point\u2014$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO.\n\r\n\r\n And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess\u2014and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.\n\r\n\r\n But I\u2019m the one that did that. So\u2014but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2.\n\r\n\r\n The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don\u2019t know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They\u2019re closing all their plants. They\u2019re closing their nuclear. They\u2019re closing their coal. They\u2019re closing a lot of plants. And they are\u2014they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason\u2019s question? Have you asked John Kelly to publicly refute The Atlantic? And then, can I ask something else?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No.\n\r\n\r\n I was very heartened to see that a friend of his\u2014because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him\u2014I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did\u2014I guess, late last night\u2014that it was not true.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Can I ask another question on a different topic, Mr. President? Mr. President, what exactly is un-American about federal government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re going to do a report. Yeah, I fired those people; they\u2019re all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we\u2019re going to give you a big report that\u2019s going to make you very happy.\n\r\n\r\n All right, yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you. Darlene Superville, AP. You said a moment ago, \u201cThey\u2019ll say anything.\u201d You were talking about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their comments about the vaccine. You have asserted \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They\u2019re going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it\u2014and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson &amp; Johnson, I spoke to the head of the greatest medical companies in the world. We\u2019re doing great. We\u2019re going to have it soon.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Right \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. So now what they\u2019re saying is, \u201cOh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.\u201d By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn\u2019t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn\u2019t have it all.\n\r\n\r\n So we\u2019re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I\u2019m talking about.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: But let me just tell you\u2014wait. And what they\u2019re doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources\u2014if you have sources\u2014if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.\n\r\n\r\n So now they\u2019re saying, \u201cWow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let\u2019s disparage the vaccine.\u201d That\u2019s so bad for this country. That\u2019s so bad for the world to even say that. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying.\n\r\n\r\n But I watched Kamala\u2019s poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero, and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn\u2019t like her, and I understand why. She will never be President\u2014although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Right, but \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: But you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you\u2019re going to have to look at her a little bit too closely.\n\r\n\r\n But she\u2019s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don\u2019t think the achievement was a great achievement. I don\u2019t want the achievement for myself, I want something that\u2019s going to make people better, that people aren\u2019t going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we\u2019re doing equally as well. Therapeutics.\n\r\n\r\n Q: May I finish? May I finish the question?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Your point is that: What they\u2019re saying is that they\u2019re saying it for a political purposes.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You have asserted repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by\u2014before the election, by the end of October.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn\u2019t say\u2014I didn\u2019t say \u201cthey will.\u201d I said, \u201cBy the end of the year.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Q: Aren\u2019t you doing the same thing that you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, but you\u2019re not quoting me accurately.\n\r\n\r\n Q\u2014say they\u2019re guilty of?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market\u2014they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else.\n\r\n\r\n You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we\u2019re going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.\n\r\n\r\n So I didn\u2019t say what you said. What I said is \u201cby the end of the year.\u201d But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But aren\u2019t you also saying that for political reasons?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, I\u2019m saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast\u2014with me, it\u2019s: The faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I\u2019m saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have\u2014if get the vaccine early, that\u2019s a great thing, whether it\u2019s politics or not.\n\r\n\r\n Now, do benefits inure if you\u2019re able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it\u2019s the most important thing.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, go ahead. In the back.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Hi. Just based on some of your recent tweets, do you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You sound so clear as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Your tweets about the 1619 Project \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q\u2014why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, so\u2014no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I\u2019m not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don\u2019t study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately.\n\r\n\r\n But we grew up with a certain history, and now they\u2019re trying to change our history\u2014revisionist history. That\u2019s why they want to take down our monuments. That\u2019s why they want to take down our statues.\n\r\n\r\n I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it\u2014the D.C. committee, but the D.C. committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson\u2014I mean, we\u2019re talking about\u2014this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to re-designate it. They want to take some down. No, we don\u2019t do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that.\n\r\n\r\n Well, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we\u2019re having tremendous success, whether it\u2019s on the vaccines, whether it\u2019s on the pandemic\u2014the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen because I will never feel the same about China. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you very much, everybody.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. Happy Labor Day. That was, really, a very special time I had speaking to some of the labor union heads and other people. They\u2019re very happy with the way things are going. As you probably see, the numbers are terrific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they\u2019re doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It\u2019s why I thought we\u2019d do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we\u2019re doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we\u2019re rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, and we\u2019ve have added a record-setting 10.6 million jobs since May. 10.6 million jobs since May. That\u2019s a record that is not even close. Second place is a long ways away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections, where you\u2019d go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead, the unemployment rate plunged, really, to the surprise of many, all the way down to 8.4 percent in August. And that\u2019s the second-largest single month decline on record. And we have the first; we have both of them. So we have the two number-one declines\u2014\u201cdecline\u201d meaning positive, not negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history\u2014world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small\u2014very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, I project. And some people are starting to agree. We have a \u201cV\u201d shape. It\u2019s probably a \u201csuper V.\u201d And you see what\u2019s going on with the stock market, where it\u2019s, in certain cases, already setting records. NASDAQ: has set 17 records already, and this is as we\u2019re, hopefully, rounding the final turn in the pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we\u2019ll end the pandemic. Under Operation Warp Speed, we\u2019ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April. You don\u2019t hear that from the press very often. They don\u2019t like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85 percent\u2014think of that\u2014since April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States has experienced among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. And we are an absolute leader in every way. Under my leadership, we\u2019ll produce a vaccine in record time. Biden and his very liberal running mate\u2014the most liberal person in Congress, by the way, who\u2019s not a competent person, in my opinion; would destroy this country and would destroy this economy\u2014should immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now, talking about endangering lives. And it undermines science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what\u2019s happening is, all of a sudden, you\u2019ll have this incredible vaccine, and because of that fake rhetoric\u2014it\u2019s a politic rhetoric; that\u2019s all it is. Just for politics. Because now they see we\u2019ve done an incredible job, and in speed like nobody has ever seen before. This could\u2019ve taken two or three years, and instead it\u2019s going to be\u2014it\u2019s going to be done in a very short of period of time. Could even have it during the month of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, contrary to all of the lies, the vaccine that they\u2019re\u2014they politicalize. They\u2019ll say anything. And it\u2019s so dangerous for our country, what they say. But the vaccine will be very safe and very effective, and it will be delivered very soon. You could\u2014you could have a very big surprise coming up. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very happy. But the people will be happy. The people of the world will be happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we\u2019ll return to unprecedented prosperity through our pro-American policies. We\u2019ll pass new tax cuts to boost take-home pay. We\u2019re going to be cutting taxes very substantially. We get it back through growth. We had tremendous growth until we got hit with the China virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ll continue our historic regulatory reduction campaign. We\u2019ve\u2014as you know, in three and a half years, we\u2019ve cut more regulations than any other administration, no matter how long, no matter what period of time you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll enact fair trade deals, and we\u2019re working on seven major fair trade deals right now. And when I say \u201cfair,\u201d fair to our country\u2014because our country was ripped off by every nation. Friend, foe, didn\u2019t matter: Every nation was ripping us off at a level that it\u2019s just unbelievable, to be honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re going to be expanding Opportunity Zones, and we will keep that going. It\u2019s been a tremendous\u2014a tremendous program. I want to thank Senator Scott, South Carolina, for coming up with that whole concept, because he came up, and I liked it right away, and it was\u2014it\u2019s really turned out to be a tremendous thing, especially for African Americans, Hispanic Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ll continue to unleash American energy. We\u2019re number one in the world. And we\u2019re totally energy independent right now. And in 2021, we\u2019ll create 10 million jobs, at least, in the first 10 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joe Biden and the radical, socialist Democrats would immediately collapse the economy. If they got in, they would collapse it. You\u2019ll have a crash the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen before. Your stocks, your 401(k)s\u2014remember, it\u2019s the people that own these massive, listed companies. A lot of people: rich people and not so rich people and middle-income people. And those stocks will crash like you\u2019ve never seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biden plan begins with a 4-trillion-dollar tax hike. And that will end everything, including growth. There won\u2019t be growth. There\u2019ll be total contraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden has also pledged to demolish the U.S. energy industry and implement the same policies causing blackouts in California. He wants to have things lit up with wind. He\u2019ll have to talk to China, Russia, India, and lots of other countries, because they\u2019re not doing that. And if they\u2019re not doing it, it puts us at a tremendous economic disadvantage, and it doesn\u2019t work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You take a look at the blackouts in California; it\u2019s really rather amazing what\u2019s going on there. They\u2019ve tried to go, and that\u2019s just with a small portion going that route. That doesn\u2019t work, and it can\u2019t fire up our big plants. We\u2019re going to have this great industry that we\u2019ve created. Can\u2019t fire up our big plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden\u2019s plan for the China virus is to shut down the entire U.S. economy. He\u2019s going to totally rely on somebody to walk up, \u201cYes, sir, it\u2019s time to shut it down.\u201d He\u2019d be laying off tens of millions of workers and causing countless deaths from suicide, substance abuse, depression, heart disease, and other very serious illnesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because when you do a shutdown, there\u2019s a problem on the other side; it\u2019s not just from the virus. You have a big problem with suicides, with losing your jobs, with all sorts of things. You just take a look. Depression is a massive problem. And what happens is you\u2014they turn to substance abuse, alcohol, drugs. So we can\u2019t do that. And then we\u2019d have to give up all of the gains that I\u2019ve been talking about over the last three months. We\u2019ve\u2014what we have done is incredible. We\u2019re setting records. All over the world, no matter where you go, nobody has done what we\u2019ve been able to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we\u2019re setting records in jobs. We\u2019re setting records in numbers. And you\u2019re going to see some very big numbers. Third-quarter numbers are coming out right before a very special day, November 3rd. So you have the numbers coming out, and they\u2019re, I think, going to be fantastic. You know, I think they\u2019re going to be fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best numbers of all, if somebody doesn\u2019t come along and raise taxes\u2014double, triple, quadruple your taxes\u2014will be the numbers from next year. But you\u2019re going to have a good third-quarter number coming out. And I think it\u2019s going to be hard for even the media to disparage that number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden wants to surrender our country to the virus, he wants to surrender our families to the violent left-wing mob, and he wants to surrender our jobs to China\u2014our jobs and our economic wellbeing. I\u2019ve taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. No other President has done what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve given much of it to the farmers. I\u2019ve given it to farmers and manufacturers, but I\u2019ve given most of it to the U.S. Treasury. Nobody has done that. We haven\u2019t taken in 10 cents from China ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They targeted our farmers, and I targeted them. And I gave $28 billion to our farmers. Our farmers wouldn\u2019t be existent right now. Right now, they\u2019re very happy. In fact, they\u2019re setting records on purchases. China is purchasing more corn than they\u2019ve ever done. Record purchase of corn and soybeans, beef\u2014because they know I\u2019m not happy with them. They know I\u2019m not happy at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, frankly, I don\u2019t want to set the world necessarily to thinking too much about it right now, but there\u2019s been no country anywhere, at any time, that\u2019s ripped us off like China has. We lose billions and billions of dollars for years and years, decades. We\u2019ve lost billions and billions and billions of dollars by dealing with China. We get nothing from China. They get nothing, other than loss, other than giving our money. And they take that money, and they build their military. And you see they\u2019re building up a powerful military. And it\u2019s very lucky that I\u2019ve been building our up, because otherwise we\u2019d be dwarfed right now by China. We would be a terrible thing. A terrible thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re way ahead on the nuclear front. We\u2019ve upgraded our nuclear. Hope to God we never have to use it. But we would be in a position that we are not in right now. But China is spending the money we give them to build up their military. So when you mention the world \u201cdecouple,\u201d it\u2019s an interesting word. So we lose billions of dollars, and if we didn\u2019t do business with them, we wouldn\u2019t lose billions of dollars. It\u2019s called \u201cdecoupling.\u201d So you\u2019ll start thinking about it. You\u2019ll start thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They take our money, and they spend it on building airplanes and building ships and building rockets and missiles. And Biden has been just a pawn for them. He\u2019s been so easy. They dream about Biden. There was a report today that they hope that Joe Biden becomes President. If Joe Biden becomes President, China will own the United States, and every other country will be smiling also. They\u2019ll be smiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When reports come out that certain countries don\u2019t really like me too much, that\u2019s not because of my personality, although it could be that also, frankly. It\u2019s because of the fact that I\u2019ve been very tough on countries that have been ripping us off for so many years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at NATO, with the exception of eight countries\u2014we\u2019re one of them\u2014every country is way behind. They\u2019re delinquent, especially Germany, in paying their NATO bills. That means we end up paying it, and we\u2019re not doing it. I told them; we\u2019re not doing it. And they\u2019ve increased their spending now $130 billion, going up to $400 billion a year. It\u2019s all because of me. Then you hear the country doesn\u2019t like me. I mean, I can understand that, because President Obama and other presidents, in all fairness, would go in there and they\u2019d make a speech and they\u2019d leave. I went in there, I looked, and I said, \u201cThis is unfair. We\u2019re paying for NATO.\u201d We\u2019re paying for NATO. Almost all of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So they rip us off on the military and then they rip us off, with the European Union, on trade. And Biden doesn\u2019t have a clue. You know he doesn\u2019t have a clue. Everybody knows he doesn\u2019t have a clue. In primetime, he wasn\u2019t good. And now it\u2019s not primetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He spent 47 years sending American jobs to China, to Mexico, and to other countries, while collecting millions of dollars in campaign and super PAC contributions from global corporations that got rich by making American workers poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His son, \u201cWhere is Hunter?\u201d\u2014Where is Hunter?\u2014I call him \u201cWhere is Hunter?\u201d\u2014walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, even though he never did that before. He walked away with a fortune from Ukraine, from China, and from other countries. Between his son and his brother, you ought to read the statements. And the press doesn\u2019t pick that up. If I ever did that, it would be\u2014it would be hell, even worse than it\u2019s been. Okay? Even worse than it\u2019s been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he\u2019s done is so incredible. \u201cI won\u2019t give them the billion dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cI won\u2019t give them, unless they get rid of that prosecutor.\u201d And then, voila, they got rid of the prosecutor. And the press doesn\u2019t even want to talk about it. You talk about quid pro quo. With me, there was none. With him, he\u2019s right on tape, and you don\u2019t want to cover it. You should be ashamed of yourselves. The press should be ashamed of themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Biden shipped away our jobs, threw open our borders, and sent our youth to fight in these crazy endless wars. And it\u2019s one of the reasons the military\u2014I\u2019m not saying the military is in love with me; the soldiers are. The top people in the Pentagon probably aren\u2019t because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we\u2019re getting out of the endless wars; you know how we\u2019re we doing. We defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate\u2014100 percent. When I was in\u2014when I came in, it was a mess; it was all over. They have it, in a certain color, all ISIS. A year later, I said, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all gone, sir. Because of you, it\u2019s all gone,\u201d because of my philosophy. But all gone. And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Let\u2019s bring our soldiers back home. Some people don\u2019t like to come home. Some people like to continue to spend money.\u201d One cold-hearted globalist betrayal after another, and that\u2019s what it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden supported NAFTA. He supported China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. Two disasters. The most disastrous trade deals in history, both of them. I can\u2019t tell you which was worse; they were both terrible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as you know, I ended it, and I ended NAFTA. And we\u2019re looking at the World Trade Organization. They\u2019ve become much better\u2014I will say that. We\u2014World Health, I got out of because we\u2019re spending $500 million. China was spending $38 million, and China controlled it. But World Trade, we\u2019re looking at it. They\u2019ve been very nice to us lately, I will say that\u2014amazingly. We never used to win anything at the World Trade; would lose every case. Now, all of a sudden, we\u2019re winning a lot of cases. We just won $7 billion as a case. And they\u2019re talking to us much differently than they used to, because if they don\u2019t shape up, we\u2019re going to ship out. That\u2019s all. We\u2019re not treated fairly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China is treated as a developing nation. Developing nation. We\u2019re treated as a nation that\u2019s fully developed. We\u2019re not fully developed, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2014when you look around at Portland and you see what these Democrats are doing to our cities. Take a look at what\u2019s happening in New York and Chicago, where you have Democrat-run cities and mayors that are running, and governors that are running states so badly, and mayors running cities so badly. It\u2019s very sad to look at it. It\u2019s Democrat-run, every one of them that I see. I guess we could probably find one or two that aren\u2019t. But I don\u2019t\u2014so far, I haven\u2019t been able to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at Biden, he supported TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a disaster; it would have destroyed our automobile business. By the way, many plants are being built right now\u2014auto plants\u2014in Michigan, just like I said. They\u2019re being built in Ohio; they\u2019re being built in South Carolina, North Carolina. They\u2019re being built all over and expanded at a level that we\u2019ve never seen before, because I said to Japan and Germany and others: \u201cSorry, you got to come here and build plants. Otherwise, we\u2019re going to have to make it very tough on you with tariffs.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we got out of the horrible Paris Climate Accord that he\u2019ll go back into because, you know, it sounds wonderful. It\u2019s a disaster for this country. They\u2019ve basically taken away your wealth, the Paris Climate Accord. And the other countries don\u2019t have to adhere to it. China doesn\u2019t kick in until 2030; they don\u2019t have to do anything until 2030. We had very high standards. We would have had to close, under some scenarios, 25 percent of our businesses in order to qualify under this ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. It sounds good. It was very bad, very expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The New York Times has just published an entire story on Biden\u2019s China sell-outs, which is amazing for the New York Times. I appreciate that. In 2001, Biden said, \u201cThe United States welcomes the emergence of a prosperous, integrated China on the global stage because we expect this is going to be a China that plays by the rules.\u201d They didn\u2019t play by the rules. They didn\u2019t play by the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Trade Organization, one of the reasons it\u2019s so bad is that China didn\u2019t play by the rules. We did. We did. But their rules were easier because they\u2019re considered a developing nation, so they had a much lower standard. But even that, they didn\u2019t play by the rules. That\u2019s when they became a rocket ship. They were flat-lined for years and years and years. Then they joined the World Trade Organization. And, frankly, they cheated. Okay? They cheated. I\u2019ll say it. What difference does it make? I feel much differently. I feel I made a great trade deal with China. Great. And they\u2019re buying. You know why they\u2019re buying? Because they know I\u2019m not happy. That\u2019s why they\u2019re buying. And I talk about it because today is Labor Day, and it\u2019s a good to time talk about when we\u2019re being ripped off by countries. But nobody is even close to China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden cheered China\u2019s rise as a great power \u201cbecause great powers adhere to international norms in the areas of nonproliferation, human rights, and trade.\u201d Well, they didn\u2019t. They took advantage of stupid people. Stupid people. And Biden is a stupid person. You know that. You\u2019re not going to write it. But you know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost of Biden\u2019s economic treachery was 60,000 shuttered American factories. And I heard this morning the real number is probably 70,000\u201470,000 shuttered American factories. And he\u2019s talking about how wonderful it is with China. No, China has been very bad, on top of which we had the China plague sent to us and other viruses\u2014nothing near this serious\u2014but the swine, and we had other viruses sent in over the years that came from China. I wonder why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Biden wins, China wins, because China will own this country. If Biden wins, China will own this country, and hopefully you\u2019re not going to be able to find that out. It\u2019s the most important election in our history, right now. Most important election in our history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under my administration, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we\u2019ll end our reliance on China once and for all. Whether it\u2019s decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I\u2019ve been doing already, we\u2019re going to end our reliance on China because we can\u2019t rely on China. And I don\u2019t want them building a military like they\u2019re building right now, and they\u2019re using our money to build it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ll manufacture our critical medical supplies in the United States. We\u2019ll create \u201cMade in America\u201d tax credits and bring our jobs back from China to the United States. And we\u2019ll impose tariffs on companies that desert America to create jobs in China and other countries. If they can\u2019t do it here, then let them pay a big tax to build it someplace else and send it into our country. We\u2019ll prohibit federal contracts from companies that outsource to China. And we\u2019ll hold China accountable for allowing the virus to spread around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can understand why China would much rather see Sleepy Joe than Donald Trump. But as long as I\u2019m President, we will never waver in our undying loyalty to the American worker and to our country as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Happy Labor Day, everybody. Yeah. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thanks, Mr. President. The issue of what happened when you were in France continues to be a story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re going to have to take that off, please. Just\u2014you can take it off. Your health\u2014how many feet are you away?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I\u2019ll speak a lot louder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you don\u2019t take it off, you\u2019re very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I\u2019ll just speak a lot louder. Is that better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s better, yeah. It\u2019s better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, some people are having a hard time believing your denials of the Atlantic story because of what you said about John McCain in the past. Do you understand that? And have you asked John Kelly \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t understand that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And have you asked John Kelly to refute that story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I don\u2019t understand it at all, no, because I\u2019ve always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we\u2019re going to win them. And, frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that\u2019s been very obvious. I was\u2014but I had to approve his entire\u2014his funeral. I wanted him to get\u2014he deserved a first-class\u2014you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket\u2014a lot of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, no, I was never a fan of John McCain because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn\u2019t. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of\u2014our great vets\u2014was not good, not appropriate. And, of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody\u2014am I supposed to say, \u201cWhat a wonderful guy\u201d?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it\u2019s turned out to be right. But I wasn\u2019t a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn\u2019t mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn\u2019t agree with him on a lot of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself\u2014which I don\u2019t read, but I hear it\u2019s just totally anti-Trump; he\u2019s a big Obama person, he\u2019s a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It\u2019s a totally made-up story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s\u2014I think that\u2019s number 15\u2014and these are people that were there. That\u2019s the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it\u2019s not true. He just came out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it\u2019s a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There\u2019s nobody\u2014and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn\u2019t hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I\u2019ve just about ever seen. And it was a fog you\u2014you literally couldn\u2019t see. I walked out, and I didn\u2019t have\u2014I didn\u2019t need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can take helicopters in this.\u201d I understand helicopters very well. And they said, \u201cNo, sir, that\u2019s been cancelled.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They would have had to go\u2014Secret Service, I have the whole list\u2014they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do it,\u201d because they\u2019re not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for two hours, three hours, four hours. I didn\u2019t care. It didn\u2019t matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, \u201cSir, we can\u2019t allow you to make this trip.\u201d If I wanted to: \u201cSir, we can\u2019t allow you, from a safety standpoint.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier\u2014the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there\u2019ll be more phony stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that\u2019s denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he\u2019s probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that\u2019s enough of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you. Christina Bobb, One America News. Thank you for holding the briefing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: We\u2019re seeing judges, most recently in Detroit, limit police ability to use non-lethal force. My first question would be: Should the police be allowed to use non-lethal force to quell the violence in their cities?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re talking about where? Non-lethal force?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Right. So in the riots, most recently \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: The riots?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think what\u2019s happened is the\u2014the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there\u2019s no\u2014there\u2019s no retribution. There\u2019s no\u2014they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I\u2019ve told, when we have the federal in there\u2014as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a\u2014another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After two and a half days, they didn\u2019t arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren\u2019t playing games. They can\u2019t play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there\u2019s got to be a form of retribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I watch\u2014so often, when I watch some of the areas that we\u2019re talking about\u2014now we have Rochester\u2014that\u2019s, again, Democrat governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was with the governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how they allow this to happen.\u201d And, you know, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different. I could talk about other governors saying the same thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please, go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: If I could follow up on that. We\u2019re also hearing reports of groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter traveling around the country, leaving their home cities to go riot and protest in other cities where they\u2019re causing damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Do we expect to see prosecution or charges \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q\u2014from the Department of Justice for those traveling for that purpose?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: So we have now over 1,000 people\u2014federal\u2014in jail. We\u2019re prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was three months ago. There hasn\u2019t been a federal monument knocked down in three months, or even thought about. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve even thought about it. So that\u2019s had a very big impact\u2014a very big impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, yeah, we\u2019re going around, and the nice part is you people take\u2014see those people up there?\u2014they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don\u2019t even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But right after that, I signed a\u2014an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They\u2019ve\u2014they\u2019ve got plenty of ideas. They\u2019re not at want for ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please, go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. Spunt\u2014David Spunt from Fox News. Mr. Trump\u2014Mr. President, thank you for taking my question. Sir, you talked a lot about the economy and touted the economy. Three weeks ago, in Bedminster, I asked you specifically why you have not called Democratic leadership in the White House to meet with them. If they don\u2019t want to meet, it\u2019s on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people are criticizing you. I cover you on the weekends and stuff. You\u2019re \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q\u2014doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I mean, we\u2019re in September. There is no deal. There is no hope of a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I know. I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: We\u2019re two months out from the election. What do you say to \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Don\u2019t say there\u2019s \u201cno hope.\u201d Why do you say there\u2019s \u201cno hope\u201d?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But what can you say to the millions \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: What do you know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Well, what can you say\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: What do you know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s hope, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And let me just tell you: I know my customers; that\u2019s what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don\u2019t want to make a deal because they think it\u2019s good for politics if they don\u2019t make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you\u2019re dealing with. I do. These are people that I don\u2019t have a lot of respect. I don\u2019t think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I\u2019m dealing with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I don\u2019t need to meet with them to be turned down. They don\u2019t want to make a deal because they know that\u2019s good for the economy. And if they make a deal that\u2019s good for the economy, and therefore it\u2019s good for me for the election in November\u2014November 3rd, and therefore they\u2019re not going to make a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want\u2014they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and states. Whether it\u2019s New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out.\u201d We\u2019ll do something to help cities, but that\u2019s going to have to rest on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why didn\u2019t you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I\u2019m dealing with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I\u2019m on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they\u2019re there. But I also know when it\u2019s time to meet with people. I\u2019ve done very well with deals, okay? That\u2019s what I do. And I know when it\u2019s time to meet. But I don\u2019t have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks\u2014which is the microphones\u2014and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So they don\u2019t want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that\u2019s good for the Democrats. But, David, that\u2019s a bad thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But as President, shouldn\u2019t you take the high road, sir?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I am taking the high road. I\u2019m taking the high road by not seeing them. That\u2019s the high road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. David \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I\u2019d do it in a minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah, David Jackson, USA Today. My question is about the Durham report, which you have talked about recently. You said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Now, you\u2019ve accused people of committing crimes against you during the Russia investigation \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Sure. Sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: \u2013including President Obama and Joe Biden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: They spied on my campaign. That\u2019s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Because my question is \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail two years ago. They would have been in jail\u2014literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail two years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But excuse me, my question is: Do you want the Justice Department to indict people over this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven\u2019t seen\u2014I purposely\u2014I don\u2019t know if that was a good thing, smart thing. I don\u2019t know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved, and maybe someday I\u2019ll get involved in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake\u2014written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats\u2014and they used that illegally in the FISA courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we did what they did, you would have many people in jail all right\u2014right now. And you have, other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents\u2014we don\u2019t have that yet, but the report hasn\u2019t been issued yet. Let\u2019s see what happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It sure sounds like you want to prosecute people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: But let me just\u2014let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden\u2014Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let\u2019s see what happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least\u2014it would have started two years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s never\u2014and nothing like that\u2019s ever happened before. Then they created, at tremendous expense\u2014the money they paid is tremendous; I\u2019m sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier\u2014a fake dossier\u2014proven to be, now, fake. Everyone\u2014and they used it in the FISA courts. That\u2019s a crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But it sure sounds like you want to prosecute \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: So far, I haven\u2019t seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn\u2019t been issued yet. Let\u2019s see what happens with the Durham report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this started at Obama, and some people would say\u2014and some people, \u201cWell, but he was President,\u201d like, \u201cLet\u2019s leave him alone.\u201d If it were me, they wouldn\u2019t be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It\u2019s a totally double standard, and it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a disgrace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if I were a Republican senator and if I were a Republican congressman\u2014and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don\u2019t fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot\u2014they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they\u2019re dirty fighters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They\u2019re not requested; they\u2019re just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, non-requested. I call them \u201cunsolicited ballots.\u201d That\u2019s going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they\u2019re going to say, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d And then they\u2019re going to harvest. They\u2019re going to do all the things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you look at the last period of six months\u2014take a look at the races where they\u2019ve sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what\u2019s happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It\u2019s a disgrace. That\u2019ll be a beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. If proven true, are you okay with Postmaster General DeJoy and the fact that he asked former employees at his private company to make donations to the GOP and then reimburse them? Are you okay with that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I don\u2019t know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don\u2019t\u2014other than that, I\u2019d have to see it. He\u2019s a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of a\u2014an approval that took place by both parties. I don\u2019t know exactly what the story is. I\u2019ll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time\u2014I read it this morning, just like you did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Would you support an investigation, sir?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And in \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I think let the investigations go. But\u2014but he\u2019s a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we\u2019ll see how that goes. But, no, I think he\u2019s a very honest guy, but we\u2019ll see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: He\u2019s proven to be a campaign \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, just a follow-up, please, if you don\u2019t mind. If it\u2019s proven to be a campaign finance scheme, do you think he should lose his job?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Always. They\u2019ve been looking at me for four years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For four years\u2014from the day I came down the escalator, I\u2019ve been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, \u201cYou have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the Office of President.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of it: They spent\u2014just Mueller alone, he spent\u2014I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was\u2014many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every\u2014and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said\u2014sophisticated friends have said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot of truth to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. After Navalny poisoning, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is under pressure to cancel Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany. Would you support such a move?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Do you think that the project should be canceled?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Sure. Well, I\u2019ve been support-\u2014I\u2019ve been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I came along, I said, \u201cWait a minute. We\u2019re protecting Germany from Russia, right?\u201d NATO. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy.\u201d And the real number is probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the\u2014what we\u2019ve done for Ukraine, relative to what the past\u2014they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I said, \u201cWhy is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we\u2019re protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?\u201d And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent because they\u2019re only paying a little more than 1 percent and they\u2019re supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump\u2014me\u2014I got the countries of NATO to spend one point\u2014$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess\u2014and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I\u2019m the one that did that. So\u2014but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don\u2019t know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They\u2019re closing all their plants. They\u2019re closing their nuclear. They\u2019re closing their coal. They\u2019re closing a lot of plants. And they are\u2014they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, can I follow up Jeff Mason\u2019s question? Have you asked John Kelly to publicly refute The Atlantic? And then, can I ask something else?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was very heartened to see that a friend of his\u2014because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him\u2014I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did\u2014I guess, late last night\u2014that it was not true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Can I ask another question on a different topic, Mr. President? Mr. President, what exactly is un-American about federal government training programs that are aimed at improving inclusivity or pointing out biases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re going to do a report. Yeah, I fired those people; they\u2019re all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we\u2019re going to give you a big report that\u2019s going to make you very happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All right, yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you. Darlene Superville, AP. You said a moment ago, \u201cThey\u2019ll say anything.\u201d You were talking about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and their comments about the vaccine. You have asserted \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They\u2019re going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it\u2014and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson &amp; Johnson, I spoke to the head of the greatest medical companies in the world. We\u2019re doing great. We\u2019re going to have it soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Right \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. So now what they\u2019re saying is, \u201cOh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.\u201d By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn\u2019t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn\u2019t have it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we\u2019re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I\u2019m talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: But let me just tell you\u2014wait. And what they\u2019re doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources\u2014if you have sources\u2014if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So now they\u2019re saying, \u201cWow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let\u2019s disparage the vaccine.\u201d That\u2019s so bad for this country. That\u2019s so bad for the world to even say that. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I watched Kamala\u2019s poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero, and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn\u2019t like her, and I understand why. She will never be President\u2014although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Right, but \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: But you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you\u2019re going to have to look at her a little bit too closely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But she\u2019s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don\u2019t think the achievement was a great achievement. I don\u2019t want the achievement for myself, I want something that\u2019s going to make people better, that people aren\u2019t going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we\u2019re doing equally as well. Therapeutics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: May I finish? May I finish the question?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Your point is that: What they\u2019re saying is that they\u2019re saying it for a political purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You have asserted repeatedly that a vaccine will be on the market by\u2014before the election, by the end of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn\u2019t say\u2014I didn\u2019t say \u201cthey will.\u201d I said, \u201cBy the end of the year.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Aren\u2019t you doing the same thing that you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, but you\u2019re not quoting me accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q\u2014say they\u2019re guilty of?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market\u2014they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we\u2019re going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I didn\u2019t say what you said. What I said is \u201cby the end of the year.\u201d But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But aren\u2019t you also saying that for political reasons?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I\u2019m saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast\u2014with me, it\u2019s: The faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I\u2019m saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have\u2014if get the vaccine early, that\u2019s a great thing, whether it\u2019s politics or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, do benefits inure if you\u2019re able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it\u2019s the most important thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, go ahead. In the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Hi. Just based on some of your recent tweets, do you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You sound so clear as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Your tweets about the 1619 Project \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q\u2014why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, so\u2014no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I\u2019m not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don\u2019t study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we grew up with a certain history, and now they\u2019re trying to change our history\u2014revisionist history. That\u2019s why they want to take down our monuments. That\u2019s why they want to take down our statues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it\u2014the D.C. committee, but the D.C. committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson\u2014I mean, we\u2019re talking about\u2014this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to re-designate it. They want to take some down. No, we don\u2019t do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we\u2019re having tremendous success, whether it\u2019s on the vaccines, whether it\u2019s on the pandemic\u2014the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen because I will never feel the same about China. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much, everybody.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Trump_Hold_Press_Briefing_2020_0907.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Donald Trump holds a press conference on Labor Day.
