Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars, but a place in our collective memory. December 7th, 1941. September 11th, 2001. And January 6th, 2021.\n\r\n\r\n On that day, I was not only Vice President-elect, I was also a United States senator. And I was here at the Capitol that morning, at a classified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Hours later, the gates of the Capitol were breached.\n\r\n\r\n I had left. But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues, but to my staff, who had been forced to seek refuge in our office, converting filing cabinets into barricades.\n\r\n\r\n What the extremists who roamed these halls targeted was not only the lives of elected leaders. What they sought to degrade and destroy was not only a building, hallowed as it is. What they were assaulting were the institutions, the values, the ideals that generations of Americans have marched, picketed, and shed blood to establish and defend.\n\r\n\r\n On January 6th, we all saw what our nation would look like if the forces who seek to dismantle our democracy are successful. The lawlessness, the violence, the chaos.\n\r\n\r\n What was at stake then, and now, is the right to have our future decided the way the Constitution prescribes it: by we, the people\u2014all the people.\n\r\n\r\n We cannot let our future be decided by those bent on silencing our voices, overturning our votes, and peddling lies and misinformation; by some radical faction that may be newly resurgent but whose roots run old and deep.\n\r\n\r\n When I meet with young people, they often ask about the state of our democracy, about January 6th. And what I tell them is: January 6th reflects the dual nature of democracy\u2014its fragility and its strength.\n\r\n\r\n You see, the strength of democracy is the rule of law. The strength of democracy is the principle that everyone should be treated equally, that elections should be free and fair, that corruption should be given no quarter. The strength of democracy is that it empowers the people.\n\r\n\r\n And the fragility of democracy is this: that if we are not vigilant, if we do not defend it, democracy simply will not stand; it will falter and fail.\n\r\n\r\n The violent assault that took place here, the very fact of how close we came to an election overturned\u2014that reflects the fragility of democracy.\n\r\n\r\n Yet, the resolve I saw in our elected leaders when I returned to the Senate chamber that night\u2014their resolve not to yield but to certify the election; their loyalty not to party or person but to the Constitution of the United States\u2014that reflects its strength.\n\r\n\r\n And so, of course, does the heroism of the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other law enforcement officers who answered the call that day, including those who later succumbed to wounds, both visible and invisible.\n\r\n\r\n Our thoughts are with all of the families who have lost a loved one.\n\r\n\r\n You know, I wonder, how will January 6th come to be remembered in the years ahead?\n\r\n\r\n Will it be remembered as a moment that accelerated the unraveling of the oldest, greatest democracy in the world or a moment when we decided to secure and strengthen our democracy for generations to come?\n\r\n\r\n The American spirit is being tested.\n\r\n\r\n The answer to whether we will meet that test resides where it always has resided in our country\u2014with you, the people.\n\r\n\r\n And the work ahead will not be easy. Here, in this very building, a decision will be made about whether we uphold the right to vote and ensure free and fair election.\n\r\n\r\n Let's be clear: We must pass the voting rights bills that are now before the Senate, and the American people must also do something more.\n\r\n\r\n We cannot sit on the sidelines. We must unite in defense of our democracy in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our prosperity and posterity.\n\r\n\r\n That is the preamble of the Constitution that President Biden and I swore an oath to uphold and defend. And that is the enduring promise of the United States of America.\n\r\n\r\n My fellow Americans, it is my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment, a leader whose life's work has been moving our nation toward that more perfect union: President Joe Biden.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked\u2014simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution\u2014our Constitution\u2014faced the gravest of threats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut they failed. They failed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is\u2014on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbove him\u2014above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda\u2014is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The facts and the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, here is the God\u2019s truth about January 6th, 2021:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClose your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 140 police officers were injured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019ve all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med-\u2014\u201cmedieval\u201d battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey\u2019ve repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone\u2014anyone\u2014diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what did we not see?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe didn\u2019t see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack\u2014sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation\u2019s capital under siege.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis wasn\u2019t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey weren\u2019t looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were looking to uphold\u2014they weren\u2019t looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey weren\u2019t looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis isn\u2019t about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn\u2019t buried.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\u2019s the only way forward. That\u2019s what great nations do. They don\u2019t bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that\u2019s the truth: They face up to it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are a great nation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy fellow Americans, in life, there\u2019s truth and, tragically, there are lies\u2014lies conceived and spread for profit and power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd here is the truth: The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He\u2019s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country\u2019s interests and America\u2019s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe can\u2019t accept he lost, even though that\u2019s what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\u2019s what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe has done what no president in American history\u2014the history of this country\u2014has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party\u2014the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible\u2014anything.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day\u2014November 3rd, 2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThink about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you think of a more twisted way to look at this country\u2014to look at America? I cannot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere\u2019s the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic\u2014some at grea-\u2014great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, in state after state, new laws are being written\u2014not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s undemocratic. And frankly, it\u2019s un-American.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can\u2019t be trusted.\n\r\n\r\n The truth is that no election\u2014no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected\u2014often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia\u2014Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, let\u2019s speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn\u2019t based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse\u2014a pretext\u2014to cover for the truth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe\u2019s not just a former president. He\u2019s a defeated former president\u2014defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd\u2014the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives\u2014elections in which they closed the gap in the House.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey challenge none of that. The President\u2019s name was first, then we went down the line\u2014governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only difference: The former President didn\u2019t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation\u2019s true patriots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can\u2019t love your country only when you win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can\u2019t obey the law only when it\u2019s convenient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can\u2019t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America\u2014at American democracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey didn\u2019t come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage\u2014not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who incited the mob\u2014the real plotters\u2014who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut their plot was foiled. Congressmen\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014stayed. Senators, representatives, staff\u2014they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook, folks, now it\u2019s up to all of us\u2014to \u201cWe the People\u201d\u2014to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake no mistake about it: We\u2019re living at an inflection point in history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth at home and abroad, we\u2019re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people\u2019s right of self-determination and self-\u2014the self-seeking autocrat.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom China to Russia and beyond, they\u2019re betting that democracy\u2019s days are numbered. They\u2019ve actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today\u2019s rapidly changing, complicated world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd they\u2019re betting\u2014they\u2019re betting America will become more like them and less like us. They\u2019re betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world\u2014literally changed the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully\u2014never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd they committed to paper an idea that couldn\u2019t live up to\u2014they couldn\u2019t live up to but an idea that couldn\u2019t be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey want to rule or they will ruin\u2014ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What\u2014and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors\u2014maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they\u2019re not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea\u2014an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we stand here today\u2014one year since January 6th, 2021\u2014the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day\u2014from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon\u2019t kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI said it many times and it\u2019s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious\u2014and greatness of this nation, we will win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelieve me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I\u2019m crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us\u2014about us, not about \u201cme.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago\u2014of liberty, freedom, and equality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We\u2019re a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, let us remember: Together, we\u2019re one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGod bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.", "transcript_html": "<p>VICE PRESIDENT: Fellow Americans, good morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain dates echo throughout history, including dates that instantly remind all who have lived through them\u2014where they were and what they were doing when our democracy came under assault.

And that is the enduring promise of the United States of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My fellow Americans, it is my honor to introduce a public servant with the character and fortitude to meet this moment, a leader whose life's work has been moving our nation toward that more perfect union: President Joe Biden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Madam Vice President, my fellow Americans: To state the obvious, one year ago today, in this sacred place, democracy was attacked\u2014simply attacked. The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution\u2014our Constitution\u2014faced the gravest of threats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutnumbered and in the face of a brutal attack, the Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police Department, the National Guard, and other brave law enforcement officials saved the rule of law.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur democracy held. We the people endured. And we the people prevailed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor the first time in our history, a president had not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut they failed. They failed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd on this day of remembrance, we must make sure that such an attack never, never happens again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI\u2019m speaking to you today from Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. This is where the House of Representatives met for 50 years in the decades leading up to the Civil War. This is\u2014on this floor is where a young congressman of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln, sat at desk 191.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbove him\u2014above us, over that door leading into the Rotunda\u2014is a sculpture depicting Clio, the muse of history. In her hands, an open book in which she records the events taking place in this chamber below.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClio stood watch over this hall one year ago today, as she has for more than 200 years. She recorded what took place. The real history. The real facts. The real truth. The facts and the truth that Vice President Harris just shared and that you and I and the whole world saw with our own eyes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Bible tells us that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall make us free. We shall know the truth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, here is the God\u2019s truth about January 6th, 2021:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClose your eyes. Go back to that day. What do you see? Rioters rampaging, waving for the first time inside this Capitol a Confederate flag that symbolized the cause to destroy America, to rip us apart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven during the Civil War, that never, ever happened. But it happened here in 2021.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat else do you see? A mob breaking windows, kicking in doors, breaching the Capitol. American flags on poles being used as weapons, as spears. Fire extinguishers being thrown at the heads of police officers.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA crowd that professes their love for law enforcement assaulted those police officers, dragged them, sprayed them, stomped on them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 140 police officers were injured.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe\u2019ve all heard the police officers who were there that day testify to what happened. One officer called it, quote, a med-\u2014\u201cmedieval\u201d battle, and that he was more afraid that day than he was fighting the war in Iraq.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey\u2019ve repeatedly asked since that day: How dare anyone\u2014anyone\u2014diminish, belittle, or deny the hell they were put through?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe saw it with our own eyes. Rioters menaced these halls, threatening the life of the Speaker of the House, literally erecting gallows to hang the Vice President of the United States of America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut what did we not see?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe didn\u2019t see a former president, who had just rallied the mob to attack\u2014sitting in the private dining room off the Oval Office in the White House, watching it all on television and doing nothing for hours as police were assaulted, lives at risk, and the nation\u2019s capital under siege.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis wasn\u2019t a group of tourists. This was an armed insurrection.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey weren\u2019t looking to uphold the will of the people. They were looking to deny the will of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were looking to uphold\u2014they weren\u2019t looking to uphold a free and fair election. They were looking to overturn one.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey weren\u2019t looking to save the cause of America. They were looking to subvert the Constitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis isn\u2019t about being bogged down in the past. This is about making sure the past isn\u2019t buried.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\u2019s the only way forward. That\u2019s what great nations do. They don\u2019t bury the truth, they face up to it. Sounds like hyperbole, but that\u2019s the truth: They face up to it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are a great nation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy fellow Americans, in life, there\u2019s truth and, tragically, there are lies\u2014lies conceived and spread for profit and power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd here is the truth: The former president of the United States of America has created and spread a web of lies about the 2020 election. He\u2019s done so because he values power over principle, because he sees his own interests as more important than his country\u2019s interests and America\u2019s interests, and because his bruised ego matters more to him than our democracy or our Constitution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe can\u2019t accept he lost, even though that\u2019s what 93 United States senators, his own Attorney General, his own Vice President, governors and state officials in every battleground state have all said: He lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\u2019s what 81 million of you did as you voted for a new way forward.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe has done what no president in American history\u2014the history of this country\u2014has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile some courageous men and women in the Republican Party are standing against it, trying to uphold the principles of that party, too many others are transforming that party into something else. They seem no longer to want to be the party\u2014the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible\u2014anything.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, at this moment, we must decide: What kind of nation are we going to be?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre we going to be a nation that accepts political violence as a norm?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre we going to be a nation where we allow partisan election officials to overturn the legally expressed will of the people?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre we going to be a nation that lives not by the light of the truth but in the shadow of lies?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be that kind of nation. The way forward is to recognize the truth and to live by it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Big Lie being told by the former president and many Republicans who fear his wrath is that the insurrection in this country actually took place on Election Day\u2014November 3rd, 2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThink about that. Is that what you thought? Is that what you thought when you voted that day? Taking part in an insurrection? Is that what you thought you were doing? Or did you think you were carrying out your highest duty as a citizen and voting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe former president and his supporters are trying to rewrite history. They want you to see Election Day as the day of insurrection and the riot that took place here on January 6th as the true expression of the will of the people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you think of a more twisted way to look at this country\u2014to look at America? I cannot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere\u2019s the truth: The election of 2020 was the greatest demonstration of democracy in the history of this country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore of you voted in that election than have ever voted in all of American history. Over 150 million Americans went to the polls and voted that day in a pandemic\u2014some at grea-\u2014great risk to their lives. They should be applauded, not attacked.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, in state after state, new laws are being written\u2014not to protect the vote, but to deny it; not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert it; not to strengthen or protect our democracy, but because the former president lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former president and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s undemocratic. And frankly, it\u2019s un-American.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second Big Lie being told by the former President and his supporters is that the results of the election of 2020 can\u2019t be trusted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The truth is that no election\u2014no election in American history has been more closely scrutinized or more carefully counted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery legal challenge questioning the results in every court in this country that could have been made was made and was rejected\u2014often rejected by Republican-appointed judges, including judges appointed by the former president himself, from state courts to the United States Supreme Court.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecounts were undertaken in state after state. Georgia\u2014Georgia counted its results three times, with one recount by hand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhony partisan audits were undertaken long after the election in several states. None changed the results. And in some of them, the irony is the margin of victory actually grew slightly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, let\u2019s speak plainly about what happened in 2020. Even before the first ballot was cast, the former president was preemptively sowing doubt about the election results. He built his lie over months. It wasn\u2019t based on any facts. He was just looking for an excuse\u2014a pretext\u2014to cover for the truth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe\u2019s not just a former president. He\u2019s a defeated former president\u2014defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is simply zero proof the election results were inaccurate. In fact, in every venue where evidence had to be produced and an oath to tell the truth had to be taken, the former president failed to make his case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust think about this: The former president and his supporters have never been able to explain how they accept as accurate the other election results that took place on November 3rd\u2014the elections for governor, United States Senate, the House of Representatives\u2014elections in which they closed the gap in the House.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey challenge none of that. The President\u2019s name was first, then we went down the line\u2014governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only difference: The former President didn\u2019t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the third Big Lie being told by a former President and his supporters is that the mob who sought to impose their will through violence are the nation\u2019s true patriots.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs that what you thought when you looked at the mob ransacking the Capitol, destroying property, literally defecating in the hallways, rifling through desks of senators and representatives, hunting down members of congress? Patriots? Not in my view.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo me, the true patriots were the more than 150 [million] Americans who peacefully expressed their vote at the ballot box, the election workers who protected the integrity of the vote, and the heroes who defended this Capitol.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can\u2019t love your country only when you win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can\u2019t obey the law only when it\u2019s convenient.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can\u2019t be patriotic when you embrace and enable lies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who stormed this Capitol and those who instigated and incited and those who called on them to do so held a dagger at the throat of America\u2014at American democracy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey didn\u2019t come here out of patriotism or principle. They came here in rage\u2014not in service of America, but rather in service of one man.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose who incited the mob\u2014the real plotters\u2014who were desperate to deny the certification of the election and defy the will of the voters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut their plot was foiled. Congressmen\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014stayed. Senators, representatives, staff\u2014they finished their work the Constitution demanded. They honored their oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook, folks, now it\u2019s up to all of us\u2014to \u201cWe the People\u201d\u2014to stand for the rule of law, to preserve the flame of democracy, to keep the promise of America alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat promise is at risk, targeted by the forces that value brute strength over the sanctity of democracy, fear over hope, personal gain over public good.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake no mistake about it: We\u2019re living at an inflection point in history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth at home and abroad, we\u2019re engaged anew in a struggle between democracy and autocracy, between the aspirations of the many and the greed of the few, between the people\u2019s right of self-determination and self-\u2014the self-seeking autocrat.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom China to Russia and beyond, they\u2019re betting that democracy\u2019s days are numbered. They\u2019ve actually told me democracy is too slow, too bogged down by division to succeed in today\u2019s rapidly changing, complicated world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd they\u2019re betting\u2014they\u2019re betting America will become more like them and less like us. They\u2019re betting that America is a place for the autocrat, the dictator, the strongman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI do not believe that. That is not who we are. That is not who we have ever been. And that is not who we should ever, ever be.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur Founding Fathers, as imperfect as they were, set in motion an experiment that changed the world\u2014literally changed the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere in America, the people would rule, power would be transferred peacefully\u2014never at the tip of a spear or the barrel of a gun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd they committed to paper an idea that couldn\u2019t live up to\u2014they couldn\u2019t live up to but an idea that couldn\u2019t be constrained: Yes, in America all people are created equal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe reject the view that if you succeed, I fail; if you get ahead, I fall behind; if I hold you down, I somehow lift myself up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe former President, who lies about this election, and the mob that attacked this Capitol could not be further away from the core American values.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey want to rule or they will ruin\u2014ruin what our country fought for at Lexington and Concord; at Gettysburg; at Omaha Beach; Seneca Falls; Selma, Alabama. What\u2014and what we were fighting for: the right to vote, the right to govern ourselves, the right to determine our own destiny.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd with rights come responsibilities: the responsibility to see each other as neighbors\u2014maybe we disagree with that neighbor, but they\u2019re not an adversary; the responsibility to accept defeat then get back in the arena and try again the next time to make your case; the responsibility to see that America is an idea\u2014an idea that requires vigilant stewardship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs we stand here today\u2014one year since January 6th, 2021\u2014the lies that drove the anger and madness we saw in this place, they have not abated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, we have to be firm, resolute, and unyielding in our defense of the right to vote and to have that vote counted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome have already made the ultimate sacrifice in this sacred effort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJill and I have mourned police officers in this Capitol Rotunda not once but twice in the wake of January 6th: once to honor Officer Brian Sicknick, who lost his life the day after the attack, and a second time to honor Officer Billy Evans, who lost his life defending this Capitol as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe think about the others who lost their lives and were injured and everyone living with the trauma of that day\u2014from those defending this Capitol to members of Congress in both parties and their staffs, to reporters, cafeteria workers, custodial workers, and their families.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon\u2019t kid yourself: The pain and scars from that day run deep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI said it many times and it\u2019s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that, by the grace of God and the goodness and gracious\u2014and greatness of this nation, we will win.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelieve me, I know how difficult democracy is. And I\u2019m crystal clear about the threats America faces. But I also know that our darkest days can lead to light and hope.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the death and destruction, as the Vice President referenced, in Pearl Harbor came the triumph over the forces of fascism.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the brutality of Bloody Sunday on the Edmund Pettus Bridge came historic voting rights legislation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, now let us step up, write the next chapter in American history where January 6th marks not the end of democracy, but the beginning of a renaissance of liberty and fair play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI did not seek this fight brought to this Capitol one year ago today, but I will not shrink from it either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI will stand in this breach. I will defend this nation. And I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will make sure the will of the people is heard; that the ballot prevails, not violence; that authority in this nation will always be peacefully transferred.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI believe the power of the presidency and the purpose is to unite this nation, not divide it; to lift us up, not tear us apart; to be about us\u2014about us, not about \u201cme.\u201d<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeep in the heart of America burns a flame lit almost 250 years ago\u2014of liberty, freedom, and equality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is not a land of kings or dictators or autocrats. We\u2019re a nation of laws; of order, not chaos; of peace, not violence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere in America, the people rule through the ballot, and their will prevails.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, let us remember: Together, we\u2019re one nation, under God, indivisible; that today, tomorrow, and forever, at our best, we are the United States of America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGod bless you all. May God protect our troops. And may God bless those who stand watch over our democracy.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/Biden_capitol_assault_anniversary.mp3", "introduction": "<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden make remarks on the first anniversary of the violent assault on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
