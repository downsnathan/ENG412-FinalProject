Please, if you have a seat, sit down. And I got to make one check here.\n\r\n\r\n (The President leaves the podium to greet audience members.)\n\r\n\r\n (The President returns to the podium.)\n\r\n\r\n I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over. (Laughter.) Imagine how excited you\u2019d be when you\u2019re\u2014four? Five?\n\r\n\r\n AUDIENCE MEMBER: Almost five.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Almost five years old, coming to hear a President speak. (Laughter.) My Lord. In my faith, we call that purgatory. (Laughter.)&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Lauren, thank you for that gracious introduction. And in case you were wondering, I\u2014in Delaware\u2014we\u2019re a small state\u2014we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented members of Congress. And so if I didn\u2019t walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswoman\u2014(applause)\u2014immediately, that was \u2014\n\r\n\r\n How are you, Rev? Good to see you.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what\u2019s happening here.\n\r\n\r\n And to all of the descendants here today, and to the community and civil rights leaders, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget.\n\r\n\r\n You know, there\u2019s a verse in First Corinthians that says, \u201cFor now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n It is\u2014I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here. And\u2014(applause)\u2014I mean that sincerely. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n And if I didn\u2019t say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back. (Laughter.) I apologize.\n\r\n\r\n But the tour\u2014in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who\u2019s only 56 [107] years old. (Laughter.) God love her. And Mother Fletcher, who\u2019s 67 [106] years old. (Laughter.) And her brother\u2014her brother, Van Ellis, who\u2019s 100 years old. (Laughter.) And he looks like he\u2019s 60. Thank you for spending so much time with me. I really mean it. It was a great honor. A genuine honor.\n\r\n\r\n You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly. But no longer. Now your story will be known in full view.\n\r\n\r\n The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago. And yet, I\u2019m the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa\u2014(applause)\u2014I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it\u2014a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time, and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here.\n\r\n\r\n For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent, it doesn\u2019t mean that it did not take place. And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. It erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can\u2019t be buried, no matter how hard people try.\n\r\n\r\n And so it is here. Only\u2014only with truth can come healing and justice and repair. Only with truth, facing it. But that isn\u2019t enough.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n First, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis. (Applause.) To all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full.\n\r\n\r\n May 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa\u2014a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier.\n\r\n\r\n On the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy\u2014worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood\u2014a community, a way of life. Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools.\n\r\n\r\n Black veterans, like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to, who fought\u2014volunteered and fought, and came home and still faced such prejudice. (Applause.) Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and\u2014they were, at the time\u2014mom-and-plack [sic]\u2014mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors\u2014the things that make up a community.\n\r\n\r\n At the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love. Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink. Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford.\n\r\n\r\n All around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end.\n\r\n\r\n Mother Randle was just six years old\u2014six years old\u2014living with her grandmom. She said she was lucky to have a home and toys, and fortunate to live without fear.\n\r\n\r\n Mother Fletcher was seven years old, the second of seven children. The youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old. The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth\u2014not real wealth, but a different wealth\u2014a wealth in culture and community and heritage. (Applause.)&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But one night\u2014one night changed everything. Everything changed. While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside.\n\r\n\r\n It wasn\u2019t everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community. Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal\u2014Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans. A belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And it speaks to that\u2014lit the fuse. It lit it by the spark that it provided\u2014a fuse of fury\u2014was an innocent interaction that turned into an in-\u2014a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenager.\n\r\n\r\n A white mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night. But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Words were exchanged. Then a scuffle. Then shots fired. Hell was unleashed. Literal hell was unleashed.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Through the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood. Torches and guns. Shooting at will. A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off. A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside. An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads.\n\r\n\r\n Private planes\u2014private planes\u2014dropping explosives\u2014the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa.\n\r\n\r\n Eight of Greenwood\u2019s nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion\u2014across the street, at Vernon AME.\n\r\n\r\n Mother Randle said it was like war. Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around.\n\r\n\r\n The Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton [sic]\u2014excuse me\u2014Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night. And here\u2019s the poem. He said, \u201cKill them, burn them, set the pace\u2026 teach them how to keep their place. Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night.\u201d That\u2019s what he remembered in the poem that he wrote.\n\r\n\r\n One hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble.\n\r\n\r\n Less than 24 hours\u2014in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost. Insurance companies\u2014they had insurance, many of them\u2014rejected claims of damage. Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps.\n\r\n\r\n As I was told today, they were told, \u201cDon\u2019t you mention you were ever in a camp or we\u2019ll come and get you.\u201d That\u2019s what survivors told me.\n\r\n\r\n Yet no one\u2014no arrests of the mob were made. None. No proper accounting of the dead. The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people. That\u2019s all. Thirty-six people.\n\r\n\r\n But based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood\u2014the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves. Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure.\n\r\n\r\n But, you know, as we speak, the process\u2014the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started. And at this moment, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood. They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect. May their souls rest in peace.\n\r\n\r\n [Pause for a moment of silence.]\n\r\n\r\n My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre\u2014(applause)\u2014among the worst in our history, but not the only one. And for too long, forgotten by our history.\n\r\n\r\n As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory\u2014our collective memories\u2014from the news and everyday conversations. For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn\u2019t even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere.\n\r\n\r\n And most people didn\u2019t realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded\u2014the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded.\n\r\n\r\n A friend of mine, Jon Meacham\u2014I had written\u2014when I said I was running to restore the soul of America, he wrote a book called \u201cThe Soul of America\u201d\u2014not because of what I said. And there\u2019s a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend\u2014pointed hats, the robes\u2014marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Jesse, you know all about this. Washin-\u2014Washington, D.C.\n\r\n\r\n If my memory is correct, there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan. There were five, if I\u2019m not mistaken\u2014it could have been seven; I think it was five\u2014members of the United States Senate\u2014open members of the Klan. Multiple governors who were open members of the Klan.\n\r\n\r\n Most people didn\u2019t realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa. And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic. It wasn\u2019t about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute Christianity.\n\r\n\r\n The flames from those burning crosses torched every region\u2014region of the country. Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren\u2019t even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it.\n\r\n\r\n And that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture. We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn\u2019t impact us today, because it does still impact us today.\n\r\n\r\n We can\u2019t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. (Applause.) We should know the good, the bad, everything. That\u2019s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides. And we\u2019re a great nation.\n\r\n\r\n The only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild. I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen. (Applause.) And only\u2014as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal. We just have to choose to remember.\n\r\n\r\n We memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be \u2013so it can\u2019t be erased. We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can\u2019t bury pain and trauma forever.\n\r\n\r\n And at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we\u2019re facing right now as a nation.\n\r\n\r\n What many people hadn\u2019t seen before or ha-\u2014or simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer. You see it in so many places.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And there\u2019s greater recognition that, for too long, we\u2019ve allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester\u2014the view that America is a zero-sum game where there is only one winner. \u201cIf you succeed, I fail. If you get ahead, I fall behind. If you get a job, I lose mine.\u201d And maybe worst of all, \u201cIf I hold you down, I lift myself up,\u201d instead of \u201cIf you do well, we all do well.\u201d (Applause.) We see that in Greenwood.\n\r\n\r\n This story isn\u2019t about the loss of life, but a loss of living, of wealth and prosterity [prosperity] and possibilities that still reverberates today.\n\r\n\r\n Mother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker.\n\r\n\r\n Mr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War Two, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America.\n\r\n\r\n Imagine all those hotels and dinners [diners] and mom-and-pop shops that could been\u2014have been passed down this past hundred years. Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth.\n\r\n\r\n If you come from backgrounds like my\u2014my family\u2014a working-class, middle-class family\u2014the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes. Imagine what they contributed then and what they could\u2019ve contributed all these years. Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would\u2019ve meant for all of Tulsa, including the white community.\n\r\n\r\n While the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn\u2019t last. Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships. (Applause.) A highway was built right through the heart of the community. Lisa, I was talking about our west side\u2014what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered. The community\u2014cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity. Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change. That\u2019s what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n Because today, we\u2019re announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community. The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing. That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And I might add\u2014and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can\u2019t figure this one out, Congressman Horsford. But if you live in a Black community and there\u2019s another one on the other side of the highway\u2014it\u2019s a white community; it\u2019s the\u2014built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community, you\u2019re\u2014can pay more for your auto insurance.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Shockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago. Lower today. That\u2019s wrong. And we\u2019re committing to changing that.\n\r\n\r\n Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that\u2014into that home and provide for their families.\n\r\n\r\n Second, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities. As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in federal buildings, to professional services.\n\r\n\r\n We have a thing called\u2014I won\u2019t go into it all because there\u2019s not enough time now. But I\u2019m determined to use every taxpayer\u2019s dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri\u2013 to build American products. And as part of that, I\u2019m going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and brown small businesses.\n\r\n\r\n Right now, it calls for 10 percent; I\u2019m going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent (inaudible). (Applause.) I have the authority to do that.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Just imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities.\n\r\n\r\n That\u2014the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as white entrepreneurs are. But they don\u2019t have lawyers. They don\u2019t have\u2014they\u2014they don\u2019t have accountants, but they have great ideas.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make? And I promise you, that\u2019s why I set up the\u2014a national Small Business Administration that\u2019s much broader. Because they\u2019re going to get those loans.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, let\u2019s give each and every child, three and four years old, access to school\u2014not daycare, school. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n In the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities. It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child\u2014no matter what background they come from; no matter what\u2014if they start school at three years old, they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well, and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives.\n\r\n\r\n And let\u2019s unlock more than\u2014an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. (Applause.) I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like\u2014of the future, like cybersecurity.\n\r\n\r\n The reason why they don\u2019t\u2014their\u2014their students are equally able to learn as well, and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks. But they don\u2019t have\u2014they don\u2019t have the back\u2014they don\u2019t have the money to provide and build those laboratories. So, guess what? They\u2019re going to get the money to build those laboratories. (Applause.)&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n So, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let\u2019s get about the\u2014about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed Internet, creating space\u2014space to live and work and play safely.\n\r\n\r\n Let\u2019s ensure access to healthcare, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores\u2014stock the fresh vegetables and food that\u2014(applause)\u2014in fact, deal with\u2014I mean, these are all things we can do.\n\r\n\r\n Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments? The rich will be just as well off. The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better. It\u2019s about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth. It\u2019s about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us.\n\r\n\r\n But just as fundamental as any of these investments I\u2019ve discussed\u2014this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote. (Applause.) The right to vote. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n A lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him. On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him. But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing. He died, I think, about 25 hours later.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But you know what John said? He called the right to vote \u201cprecious,\u201d \u201calmost sacred.\u201d He said, \u201cThe most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society\u201d.\n\r\n\r\n This sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I\u2019ve never seen\u2014even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer\u2014with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s simply un-American. It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented. The creed \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody.\n\r\n\r\n The obstacle to proc-\u2014to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge. We saw it in the \u201860s, but with the current assault, it\u2019s not just an echo of a distant history.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n In 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more. We resolved to overcome it all, and we did. More Americans voted in the last election than any\u2014in the midst of a pandemic\u2014than any election in American history. (Applause.)&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n You got voters registered. You got voters to the polls. The rule of law held. Democracy prevailed. We overcame.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But today, let me be unequivocal: I\u2019ve been engaged in this work my whole career, and we\u2019re going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n I will have more to say about this at a later date\u2014the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters. (Applause.)&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And in June\u2014June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill. I hear all the folks on TV saying, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Biden get this done?\u201d Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But we\u2019re not giving up. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy. The Senate will take it up later this month, and I\u2019m going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage.\n\r\n\r\n The House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is\u2014which is critical\u2014(applause)\u2014to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n To signify the importance of our efforts, today I\u2019m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n With her leadership and your support, we\u2019re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of work. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And finally, we have to\u2014and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches\u2014the veins bulging on their\u2014as they were screaming. Remember? Just close your eyes and picture what it was.\n\r\n\r\n Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th], it broke her heart\u2014a mob of violent white extremists\u2014thugs. Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago.\n\r\n\r\n Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. Hate that never goes away. Hate only hides.\n\r\n\r\n Jesse, I think I mentioned this to you. I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act\u2014I thought we moved. But what I didn\u2019t realize\u2014I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But you know what, Rev? I didn\u2019t realize hate is never defeated; it only hides. It hides. And given a little bit of oxygen\u2014just a little bit oxygen\u2014by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And so, folks, we can\u2019t\u2014we must not give hate a safe harbor.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not ISIS, not al Qaeda\u2014white supremacists. (Applause.) That\u2019s not me; that\u2019s the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Two weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate. My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty [sic]\u2014of bigotry.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But I\u2019m going to close where I started. To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you. Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your commitment. And thank your children, and your grandchildren, and your unc-\u2014and your nieces and your nephews.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n To see and learn from you is a gift\u2014a genuine gift. Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America\u2019s greatest historians\u2014Tulsa\u2019s proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor\u2014said, and I quote, \u201cWhatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love. How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?\u201d\n\r\n\r\n On this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit\u2014the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today. I mean that. And the reason is because of this new generation of young people. They\u2019re the best educated, they\u2019re the least prejudiced, the most open generation in American history.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And although I have no scientific basis of what I\u2019m about to say, but those of you who are over 50\u2014how often did you ever see\u2014how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples? Not a joke.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n I challenge you\u2014find today, when you turn on the stations\u2014sit on one station for two hours. And I don\u2019t know how many commercials you\u2019ll see\u2014eight to five\u2014two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them. That\u2019s not by accident. They\u2019re selling soap, man. (Laughter.) Not a joke.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Remember ol\u2019 Pat Caddell? He used to say, \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s happening in American culture? Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.\u201d&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n We have hope in folks like you, honey. I really mean it. We have hope. But we\u2019ve got to give them support. We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done. Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn\u2019t care deeply about this. You sure in the devil didn\u2019t come to hear me speak. (Laughter.)&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n But I really mean it. I really mean it. Let\u2019s not give up, man. Let\u2019s not give up.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n As the old saying goes, \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about famous people, but I\u2019m\u2014my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They think I did it because I\u2019m Irish. They think I did it because we Irish\u2014we have a little chip on our shoulder. A little bit, sometimes.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n That\u2019s not why I did it; I did it because they\u2019re the best poets in the world. (Laughter.) You can smile, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s true.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called \u201cThe Cure at Troy\u201d\u2014Seamus Heaney. And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n It said, \u201cHistory teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.\u201d&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Let\u2019s make it rhyme. Thank you.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, sit down. And I got to make one check here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The President leaves the podium to greet audience members.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The President returns to the podium.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just had to make sure the two girls got ice cream when this is over. (Laughter.) Imagine how excited you\u2019d be when you\u2019re\u2014four? Five?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Almost five.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Almost five years old, coming to hear a President speak. (Laughter.) My Lord. In my faith, we call that purgatory. (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lauren, thank you for that gracious introduction. And in case you were wondering, I\u2014in Delaware\u2014we\u2019re a small state\u2014we have the eighth-largest Black population in America, and we have one of the most talented members of Congress. And so if I didn\u2019t walk around and pay my tribute to Lisa Blunt Rochester my congresswoman\u2014(applause)\u2014immediately, that was \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How are you, Rev? Good to see you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve got a distinguished group of people here, and I want to thank Lauren for sharing the powerful story and for helping the country understand what\u2019s happening here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to all of the descendants here today, and to the community and civil rights leaders, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus that are here: Thank you for making sure we all remember and we never forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, there\u2019s a verse in First Corinthians that says, \u201cFor now, we see in a mirror dimly, but then, face to face, now I know in part, then I shall know fully.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is\u2014I just toured the Hall of Survivors here in Greenwood Cultural Center, and I want to thank the incredible staff for hosting us here. And\u2014(applause)\u2014I mean that sincerely. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if I didn\u2019t say what my father would insist on, please excuse my back. (Laughter.) I apologize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tour\u2014in the tour, I met Mother Randle, who\u2019s only 56 [107] years old. (Laughter.) God love her. And Mother Fletcher, who\u2019s 67 [106] years old. (Laughter.) And her brother\u2014her brother, Van Ellis, who\u2019s 100 years old. (Laughter.) And he looks like he\u2019s 60. Thank you for spending so much time with me. I really mean it. It was a great honor. A genuine honor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are the three known remaining survivors of a story seen in the mirror dimly. But no longer. Now your story will be known in full view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The events we speak of today took place 100 years ago. And yet, I\u2019m the first President in 100 years ever to come to Tulsa\u2014(applause)\u2014I say that not as a compliment about me, but to think about it\u2014a hundred years, and the first President to be here during that entire time, and in this place, in this ground, to acknowledge the truth of what took place here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence, cloaked in darkness. But just because history is silent, it doesn\u2019t mean that it did not take place. And while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing. It erases nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous they can\u2019t be buried, no matter how hard people try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so it is here. Only\u2014only with truth can come healing and justice and repair. Only with truth, facing it. But that isn\u2019t enough.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we have to see, hear, and give respect to Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, and Mr. Van Ellis. (Applause.) To all those lost so many years ago, to all the descendants of those who suffered, to this community\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to shine a light, to make sure America knows the story in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May 1921: Formerly enslaved Black people and their descendants are here in Tulsa\u2014a boom town of oil and opportunity in a new frontier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the north side, across the rail tracks that divided the city already segregated by law, they built something of their own, worthy\u2014worthy of their talent and their ambition: Greenwood\u2014a community, a way of life. Black doctors and lawyers, pastors, teachers; running hospitals, law practices, libraries, churches, schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black veterans, like a man I had the privilege to giving a Command Coin to, who fought\u2014volunteered and fought, and came home and still faced such prejudice. (Applause.) Veterans had been back a few years helping after winning the first World War, building a new life back home with pride and confidence, who were a mom-and\u2014they were, at the time\u2014mom-and-plack [sic]\u2014mom-and-pop Black diners, grocery stores, barber shops, tailors\u2014the things that make up a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Dreamland Theatre, a young Black couple, holding hands, falling in love. Friends gathered at music clubs and pool halls; at the Monroe family roller-skating rink. Visitors staying in hotels, like the Stradford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around, Black pride shared by the professional class and the working class who lived together, side by side, for blocks on end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother Randle was just six years old\u2014six years old\u2014living with her grandmom. She said she was lucky to have a home and toys, and fortunate to live without fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother Fletcher was seven years old, the second of seven children. The youngest, being Mr. Van Ellis, was just a few months old. The children of former sharecroppers, when they went to bed at night in Greenwood, Mother Fletcher says they fell asleep rich in terms of the wealth\u2014not real wealth, but a different wealth\u2014a wealth in culture and community and heritage. (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one night\u2014one night changed everything. Everything changed. While Greenwood was a community to itself, it was not separated from the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn\u2019t everyone, but there was enough hate, resentment, and vengeance in the community. Enough people who believed that America does not belong to everyone and not everyone is created equal\u2014Native Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Black Americans. A belief enforced by law, by badge, by hood and by noose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it speaks to that\u2014lit the fuse. It lit it by the spark that it provided\u2014a fuse of fury\u2014was an innocent interaction that turned into an in-\u2014a terrible, terrible headline allegation of a Black male teenager attacking a white female teenager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A white mob of 1,000 gathered around the courthouse where the Black teenager was being held, ready to do what still occurred: lynch that young man that night. But 75 Black men, including Black veterans, arrived to stand guard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Words were exchanged. Then a scuffle. Then shots fired. Hell was unleashed. Literal hell was unleashed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the night and into the morning, the mob terrorized Greenwood. Torches and guns. Shooting at will. A mob tied a Black man by the waist to the back of their truck with his head banging along the pavement as they drove off. A murdered Black family draped over the fence of their home outside. An elderly couple, knelt by their bed, praying to God with their heart and their soul, when they were shot in the back of their heads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private planes\u2014private planes\u2014dropping explosives\u2014the first and only domestic aerial assault of its kind on an American city here in Tulsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eight of Greenwood\u2019s nearly two dozen churches burned, like Mt. Zion\u2014across the street, at Vernon AME.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother Randle said it was like war. Mother Fletcher says, all these years later, she still sees Black bodies around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenwood newspaper publisher A.J. Smitherton [sic]\u2014excuse me\u2014Smitherman penned a poem of what he heard and felt that night. And here\u2019s the poem. He said, \u201cKill them, burn them, set the pace\u2026 teach them how to keep their place. Reign of murder, theft, and plunder was the order of the night.\u201d That\u2019s what he remembered in the poem that he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One hundred years ago at this hour, on this first day of June, smoke darkened the Tulsa sky, rising from 35 blocks of Greenwood that were left in ash and ember, razed and in rubble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than 24 hours\u2014in less than 24 hours, 1,100 Black homes and businesses were lost. Insurance companies\u2014they had insurance, many of them\u2014rejected claims of damage. Ten thousand people were left destitute and homeless, placed in internment camps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I was told today, they were told, \u201cDon\u2019t you mention you were ever in a camp or we\u2019ll come and get you.\u201d That\u2019s what survivors told me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet no one\u2014no arrests of the mob were made. None. No proper accounting of the dead. The death toll records by local officials said there were 36 people. That\u2019s all. Thirty-six people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But based on studies, records, and accounts, the likelihood\u2014the likely number is much more, in the multiple of hundreds. Untold bodies dumped into mass graves. Families who, at the time, waited for hours and days to know the fate of their loved ones are now descendants who have gone 100 years without closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, you know, as we speak, the process\u2014the process of exhuming the unmarked graves has started. And at this moment, I\u2019d like to pause for a moment of silence for the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, sons, and daughters, friends of God and Greenwood. They deserve dignity, and they deserve our respect. May their souls rest in peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Pause for a moment of silence.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My fellow Americans, this was not a riot. This was a massacre\u2014(applause)\u2014among the worst in our history, but not the only one. And for too long, forgotten by our history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as it happened, there was a clear effort to erase it from our memory\u2014our collective memories\u2014from the news and everyday conversations. For a long time, schools in Tulsa didn\u2019t even teach it, let alone schools elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And most people didn\u2019t realize that, a century ago, a second Ku Klux Klan had been founded\u2014the second Ku Klux Klan had been founded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A friend of mine, Jon Meacham\u2014I had written\u2014when I said I was running to restore the soul of America, he wrote a book called \u201cThe Soul of America\u201d\u2014not because of what I said. And there\u2019s a picture about page 160 in his book, showing over 30,000 Ku Klux Klan members in full regalia, Reverend\u2014pointed hats, the robes\u2014marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Jesse, you know all about this. Washin-\u2014Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If my memory is correct, there were 37 members of the House of Representatives who were open members of the Klan. There were five, if I\u2019m not mistaken\u2014it could have been seven; I think it was five\u2014members of the United States Senate\u2014open members of the Klan. Multiple governors who were open members of the Klan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people didn\u2019t realize that, a century ago, the Klan was founded just six years before the horrific destruction here in Tulsa. And one of the reasons why it was founded was because of guys like me, who were Catholic. It wasn\u2019t about African Americans, then; it was about making sure that all those Polish and Irish and Italian and Eastern European Catholics who came to the United States after World War One would not pollute Christianity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flames from those burning crosses torched every region\u2014region of the country. Millions of white Americans belonged to the Klan, and they weren\u2019t even embarrassed by it; they were proud of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that hate became embedded systematically and systemically in our laws and our culture. We do ourselves no favors by pretending none of this ever happened or that it doesn\u2019t impact us today, because it does still impact us today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can\u2019t just choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. (Applause.) We should know the good, the bad, everything. That\u2019s what great nations do: They come to terms with their dark sides. And we\u2019re a great nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to build a common ground is to truly repair and to rebuild. I come here to help fill the silence, because in silence, wounds deepen. (Applause.) And only\u2014as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal. We just have to choose to remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We memorialize what happened here in Tulsa so it can be \u2013so it can\u2019t be erased. We know here, in this hallowed place, we simply can\u2019t bury pain and trauma forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And at some point, there will be a reckoning, an inflection point, like we\u2019re facing right now as a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What many people hadn\u2019t seen before or ha-\u2014or simply refused to see cannot be ignored any longer. You see it in so many places.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there\u2019s greater recognition that, for too long, we\u2019ve allowed a narrowed, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester\u2014the view that America is a zero-sum game where there is only one winner. \u201cIf you succeed, I fail. If you get ahead, I fall behind. If you get a job, I lose mine.\u201d And maybe worst of all, \u201cIf I hold you down, I lift myself up,\u201d instead of \u201cIf you do well, we all do well.\u201d (Applause.) We see that in Greenwood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story isn\u2019t about the loss of life, but a loss of living, of wealth and prosterity [prosperity] and possibilities that still reverberates today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother Fletcher talks about how she was only able to attend school until the fourth grade and eventually found work in the shipyards, as a domestic worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Van Ellis has shared how, even after enlisting and serving in World War Two, he still came home to struggle with a segregated America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine all those hotels and dinners [diners] and mom-and-pop shops that could been\u2014have been passed down this past hundred years. Imagine what could have been done for Black families in Greenwood: financial security and generational wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you come from backgrounds like my\u2014my family\u2014a working-class, middle-class family\u2014the only way we were ever able to generate any wealth was in equity in our homes. Imagine what they contributed then and what they could\u2019ve contributed all these years. Imagine a thriving Greenwood in North Tulsa for the last hundred years, what that would\u2019ve meant for all of Tulsa, including the white community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the people of Greenwood rebuilt again in the years after the massacre, it didn\u2019t last. Eventually neighborhoods were redlined on maps, locking Black Tulsa out of homeownerships. (Applause.) A highway was built right through the heart of the community. Lisa, I was talking about our west side\u2014what 95 did to it after we were occupied by the military, after Dr. King was murdered. The community\u2014cutting off Black families and businesses from jobs and opportunity. Chronic underinvestment from state and federal governments denied Greenwood even just a chance at rebuilding. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We must find the courage to change the things we know we can change. That\u2019s what Vice President Harris and I are focused on, along with our entire administration, including our Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Marcia Fudge, who is here today. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because today, we\u2019re announcing two expanded efforts targeted toward Black wealth creation that will also help the entire community. The first is: My administration has launched an aggressive effort to combat racial discrimination in housing. That includes everything from redlining to the cruel fact that a home owned by a Black family is too often appraised at a lower value than a similar home owned by a white family. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I might add\u2014and I need help if you have an answer to this; I can\u2019t figure this one out, Congressman Horsford. But if you live in a Black community and there\u2019s another one on the other side of the highway\u2014it\u2019s a white community; it\u2019s the\u2014built by the same builder, and you have a better driving record than they guy with the same car in the white community, you\u2019re\u2014can pay more for your auto insurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shockingly, the percentage of Black American homeownership is lower today in America than when the Fair Housing Act was passed more than 50 years ago. Lower today. That\u2019s wrong. And we\u2019re committing to changing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just imagine if instead of denying millions of Americans the ability to own their own home and build generational wealth, we made it possible for them to buy a home and build equity into that\u2014into that home and provide for their families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, small businesses are the engines of our economy and the glue of our communities. As President, my administration oversees hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts for everything from refurbishing decks of aircraft carriers, to installing railings in federal buildings, to professional services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a thing called\u2014I won\u2019t go into it all because there\u2019s not enough time now. But I\u2019m determined to use every taxpayer\u2019s dollar that is assigned to me to spend, going to American companies and American workers to build Ameri\u2013 to build American products. And as part of that, I\u2019m going to increase the share of the dollars the federal government spends to small, disadvantaged businesses, including Black and brown small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, it calls for 10 percent; I\u2019m going to move that to 15 percent of every dollar spent will be spent (inaudible). (Applause.) I have the authority to do that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just imagine if, instead of denying millions of entrepreneurs the ability to access capital and contracting, we made it possible to take their dreams to the marketplace to create jobs and invest in our communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2014the data shows young Black entrepreneurs are just as capable of succeeding, given the chance, as white entrepreneurs are. But they don\u2019t have lawyers. They don\u2019t have\u2014they\u2014they don\u2019t have accountants, but they have great ideas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off from the investments those people make? And I promise you, that\u2019s why I set up the\u2014a national Small Business Administration that\u2019s much broader. Because they\u2019re going to get those loans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of consigning millions of American children to under-resourced schools, let\u2019s give each and every child, three and four years old, access to school\u2014not daycare, school. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last 10 years, studies have been done by all the great universities. It shows that, if increased by 56 percent, the possibility of a child\u2014no matter what background they come from; no matter what\u2014if they start school at three years old, they have a 56 percent chance of going all through all 12 years without any trouble and being able to do well, and a chance to learn and grow and thrive in a school and throughout their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And let\u2019s unlock more than\u2014an incredible creativity and innovation that will come from the nation\u2019s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. (Applause.) I have a $5 billion program giving them the resources to invest in research centers and laboratories and high-demand fields to compete for the good-paying jobs in industries like\u2014of the future, like cybersecurity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why they don\u2019t\u2014their\u2014their students are equally able to learn as well, and get the good-paying job that start at 90- and 100,000 bucks. But they don\u2019t have\u2014they don\u2019t have the back\u2014they don\u2019t have the money to provide and build those laboratories. So, guess what? They\u2019re going to get the money to build those laboratories. (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, instead of just talking about infrastructure, let\u2019s get about the\u2014about the business of actually rebuilding roads and highways, filling the sidewalks and cracks, installing streetlights and high-speed Internet, creating space\u2014space to live and work and play safely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s ensure access to healthcare, clean water, clean air, nearby grocery stores\u2014stock the fresh vegetables and food that\u2014(applause)\u2014in fact, deal with\u2014I mean, these are all things we can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does anyone doubt this whole nation would be better off with these investments? The rich will be just as well off. The middle class will do better, and everybody will do better. It\u2019s about good-paying jobs, financial stability, and being able to build some generational wealth. It\u2019s about economic growth for our country and outcompeting the rest of the world, which is now outcompeting us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just as fundamental as any of these investments I\u2019ve discussed\u2014this may be the most fundamental: the right to vote. (Applause.) The right to vote. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of the members of the Black Caucus knew John Lewis better than I did, but I knew him. On his deathbed, like many, I called John, to speak to him. But all John wanted to do was talk about how I was doing. He died, I think, about 25 hours later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you know what John said? He called the right to vote \u201cprecious,\u201d \u201calmost sacred.\u201d He said, \u201cThe most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society\u201d.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This sacred right is under assault with an incredible intensity like I\u2019ve never seen\u2014even though I got started as a public defender and a civil rights lawyer\u2014with an intensity and an aggressiveness that we have not seen in a long, long time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s simply un-American. It is not, however, sadly, unprecedented. The creed \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d is a longtime mainstay of the Civil Rights Movement, as Jesse Jackson can tell you better than anybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obstacle to proc-\u2014to progress that have to be overcome are a constant challenge. We saw it in the \u201860s, but with the current assault, it\u2019s not just an echo of a distant history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, we faced a tireless assault on the right to vote: restrictive laws, lawsuits, threats of intimidation, voter purges, and more. We resolved to overcome it all, and we did. More Americans voted in the last election than any\u2014in the midst of a pandemic\u2014than any election in American history. (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You got voters registered. You got voters to the polls. The rule of law held. Democracy prevailed. We overcame.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But today, let me be unequivocal: I\u2019ve been engaged in this work my whole career, and we\u2019re going to be ramping up our efforts to overcome again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will have more to say about this at a later date\u2014the truly unprecedented assault on our democracy, an effort to replace nonpartisan election administrators and to intimidate those charged with tallying and reporting the election results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But today, as for the act of voting itself, I urge voting rights groups in this country to begin to redouble their efforts now to register and educate voters. (Applause.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in June\u2014June should be a month of action on Capitol Hill. I hear all the folks on TV saying, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Biden get this done?\u201d Well, because Biden only has a majority of, effectively, four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we\u2019re not giving up. Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed For the People Act to protect our democracy. The Senate will take it up later this month, and I\u2019m going to fight like heck with every tool at my disposal for its passage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The House is also working on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is\u2014which is critical\u2014(applause)\u2014to providing new legal tools to combat the new assault on the right to vote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To signify the importance of our efforts, today I\u2019m asking Vice President Harris to help these efforts and lead them, among her many other responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With her leadership and your support, we\u2019re going to overcome again, I promise you. But it\u2019s going to take a hell of a lot of work. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, we have to\u2014and finally, we must address what remains the stain on the soul of America. What happened in Greenwood was an act of hate and domestic terrorism with a through line that exists today still.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just close your eyes and remember what you saw in Charlottesville four years ago on television. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the KKK coming out of those fields at night in Virginia with lighted torches\u2014the veins bulging on their\u2014as they were screaming. Remember? Just close your eyes and picture what it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, Mother Fletcher said when she saw the insurrection at the Capitol on January the 9th [6th], it broke her heart\u2014a mob of violent white extremists\u2014thugs. Said it reminded her what happened here in Greenwood 100 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look around at the various hate crimes against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans. Hate that never goes away. Hate only hides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesse, I think I mentioned this to you. I thought, after you guys pushed through, with Dr. King, the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act\u2014I thought we moved. But what I didn\u2019t realize\u2014I thought we had made enormous progress, and I was so proud to be a little part of it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you know what, Rev? I didn\u2019t realize hate is never defeated; it only hides. It hides. And given a little bit of oxygen\u2014just a little bit oxygen\u2014by its leaders, it comes out of there from under the rock like it was happening again, as if it never went away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, folks, we can\u2019t\u2014we must not give hate a safe harbor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said in my address to the joint session of Congress: According to the intelligence community, terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not ISIS, not al Qaeda\u2014white supremacists. (Applause.) That\u2019s not me; that\u2019s the intelligence community under both Trump and under my administration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two weeks ago, I signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which the House had passed and the Senate. My administration will soon lay out our broader strategy to counter domestic terrorism and the violence driven by the most heinous hate crimes and other forms of vigorty [sic]\u2014of bigotry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I\u2019m going to close where I started. To Mother Randle, Mother Fletcher, Mr. Van Ellis, to the descendants, and to all survivors: Thank you. Thank you for giving me the honor of being able to spend some time with you earlier today. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your commitment. And thank your children, and your grandchildren, and your unc-\u2014and your nieces and your nephews.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see and learn from you is a gift\u2014a genuine gift. Dr. John Hope Franklin, one of America\u2019s greatest historians\u2014Tulsa\u2019s proud son, whose father was a Greenwood survivor\u2014said, and I quote, \u201cWhatever you do, it must be done in the spirit of goodwill and mutual respect and even love. How else can we overcome the past and be worthy of our forebearers and face the future with confidence and with hope?\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this sacred and solemn day, may we find that distinctly Greenwood spirit that defines the American spirit\u2014the spirit that gives me so much confidence and hope for the future; that helps us see, face to face; a spirit that helps us know fully who we are and who we can be as a people and as a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today. I mean that. And the reason is because of this new generation of young people. They\u2019re the best educated, they\u2019re the least prejudiced, the most open generation in American history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And although I have no scientific basis of what I\u2019m about to say, but those of you who are over 50\u2014how often did you ever see\u2014how often did you ever see advertisements on television with Black and white couples? Not a joke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I challenge you\u2014find today, when you turn on the stations\u2014sit on one station for two hours. And I don\u2019t know how many commercials you\u2019ll see\u2014eight to five\u2014two to three out of five have mixed-race couples in them. That\u2019s not by accident. They\u2019re selling soap, man. (Laughter.) Not a joke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember ol\u2019 Pat Caddell? He used to say, \u201cYou want to know what\u2019s happening in American culture? Watch advertising, because they want to sell what they have.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have hope in folks like you, honey. I really mean it. We have hope. But we\u2019ve got to give them support. We have got to give them the backbone to do what we know has to be done. Because I doubt whether any of you would be here if you didn\u2019t care deeply about this. You sure in the devil didn\u2019t come to hear me speak. (Laughter.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I really mean it. I really mean it. Let\u2019s not give up, man. Let\u2019s not give up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the old saying goes, \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about famous people, but I\u2019m\u2014my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They think I did it because I\u2019m Irish. They think I did it because we Irish\u2014we have a little chip on our shoulder. A little bit, sometimes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2019s not why I did it; I did it because they\u2019re the best poets in the world. (Laughter.) You can smile, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s true.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a famous poet who wrote a poem called \u201cThe Cure at Troy\u201d\u2014Seamus Heaney. And there is a stanza in it that I think is the definition of what I think should be our call today for young people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It said, \u201cHistory teaches us not to hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up, and hope and history rhyme.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s make it rhyme. Thank you.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Biden_Remarks_Commemorating_Anniversary_Tulsa_Race_Massacre.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Biden speaks in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on the 100th anniversary of the massacre in the African-American neighborhood of Greenwood.
