    "introduction": "<p>Following John Jay&#39;s investigation of the New York Customhouse, Hayes issues this Executive Order, which forbids the involvement of federal employees in political activities. The President takes such action in the hope that it will curtail corruption; the Executive Order stipulates that those in office can no longer be dismissed for political reasons. These events testify to Hayes&#39;s interest in civil service reform.</p>"
