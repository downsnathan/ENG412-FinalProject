A mob overwhelmed Capitol police and pushed their way into the US Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify the election results. As&nbsp;members of Congress were rushed out of harm's way, police were unable to contain the intruders who broke windows, destroyed property, and trespassed through the building. The police shot and killed one pro-Trump demonstrator as she tried to break through a door, and one Capitol police officer died of injuries sustained during the riot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the chaos, President Trump released this one-minute video via Twitter. He makes several false claims, including that the presidential election was fraudulent despite the Department of Justice reporting that they found no evidence of&nbsp;widespread fraud. Shortly after this video was posted, Twitter removed it for violating its rules and blocked&nbsp;President Trump's&nbsp;Twitter account for 12 hours, but restored it after that time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"}
