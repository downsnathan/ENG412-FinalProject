I\u2019d like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late \u2014 we\u2019re looking at them very strongly. But a lot of votes came in late.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ve already decisively won many critical states, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech.\n\r\n\r\n As everybody saw, we won by historic numbers. And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave.\n\r\n\r\n And it\u2019s been properly acknowledged, actually, by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn\u2019t do us any good.\n\r\n\r\n We kept the Senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats. And in a really \u2014 much more competitive states, we\u2019ve \u2014 we did a fantastic job with the Senate, and I think we\u2019re very proud of what\u2019s happened there. We had many more seats to defend.\n\r\n\r\n They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone \u2014 two races \u2014 and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents\u2019 major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn\u2019t believe it: zero races. Very unusual thing. Zero. And actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way.\n\r\n\r\n This was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That\u2019s a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters \u2014 the largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history.\n\r\n\r\n Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems. And Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. And we\u2019re also, I believe, the party of inclusion.\n\r\n\r\n As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls \u2014 I have to call them phony polls, fake polls \u2014 were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans\u2019 ability to raise funds. They were what\u2019s called \u201csuppression polls.\u201d Everyone knows that now. And it\u2019s never been used to the extent that it\u2019s been used on this last election.\n\r\n\r\n To highlight just a few examples: The day before election, Quinnipiac \u2014 which was wrong on every occasion that I know of \u2014 had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily. Easily. So, they had me losing Florida by a lot, and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up 4 points in Ohio, and they were off by 12.2 points. And I also won Ohio \u2014 the great state of Ohio \u2014 very easily.\n\r\n\r\n The Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that. They\u2019re not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression.\n\r\n\r\n There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run, in all cases, by Democrats.\n\r\n\r\n We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually. And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn\u2019t allow legally permissible observers. We went to court, in a couple of instances, and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away \u2014 or outside the building to observe people inside the building.\n\r\n\r\n And we won a case \u2014 a big case. And we have others happening. There are a lot of \u2014 lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation, there\u2019s tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I\u2019ve been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really destroyed our system.\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s a corrupt system. And it makes people corrupt even if they aren\u2019t by nature, but they become corrupt; it\u2019s too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them.\n\r\n\r\n And you see that on Election Night. We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot \u2014 tremendous number of votes. And we\u2019re still ahead by a lot, but not as many because they\u2019re finding ballots all of a sudden. \u201cOh, we have some mail-in ballots.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided, too. I know that it\u2019s supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they\u2019re so one-sided.\n\r\n\r\n We were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, and that gets whittled down to \u2014 I think they said now we\u2019re up by 90,000 votes. And they\u2019ll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over. And they don\u2019t want us to have any observers, although we won a court case. The judge said you have to have observers.\n\r\n\r\n Likewise, in Geor- \u2014 and they\u2019re appealing. Actually, they\u2019re appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch and we want observers, and they\u2019re actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they\u2019d appeal \u2014 that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations.\n\r\n\r\n Likewise, in Georgia, I won by a lot \u2014 a lot \u2014 with a lead of over \u2014 getting close to 300,000 votes on Election Night in Georgia. And, by the way, got whittled down, and now it\u2019s getting to be to a point where I\u2019ll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit.\n\r\n\r\n In Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.\n\r\n\r\n We also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan; won the state. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down. Every \u2014 in every case, they got whittled down.\n\r\n\r\n Today, we\u2019re on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote \u2014 55 percent margins. And that\u2019s a margin that we\u2019ve significantly exceeded. So we\u2019ll see what happens with that, but we\u2019re on track to do okay in Arizona.\n\r\n\r\n Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We\u2019ll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election, for that matter. And we can\u2019t allow silence \u2013anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ve never had \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing a lot of public things for a long time; I\u2019ve never had anything that\u2019s been as inspirational by people \u2014 calling, talking, sending things to us. I\u2019ve never seen such \u2014 such love and such affection and such spirit as I\u2019ve seen for this. People know what\u2019s happening, and they see what\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s before their eyes.\n\r\n\r\n And there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There\u2019s tremendous litigation going on. And this is a case where they\u2019re trying to steal an election, they\u2019re trying to rig an election, and we can\u2019t let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia \u2014 known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily \u2014 cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race \u2014 a very important presidential race.\n\r\n\r\n In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers, and very strongly. Now, we won the case, but they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re going forward. They don\u2019t want anybody in there. They don\u2019t want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can\u2019t imagine why. There\u2019s absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it\u2019s straight, they would be \u2014 they should be proud of it. Instead, they\u2019re trying, obviously, to commit fraud. There\u2019s no question about that.\n\r\n\r\n In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away \u2014 very far away \u2014 so far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there\u2019s been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows so you can\u2019t see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent.\n\r\n\r\n The 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day \u2014 that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren\u2019t. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn\u2019t do that.\n\r\n\r\n Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That\u2019s why they did the mail-in ballots, where there\u2019s tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That\u2019s why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I\u2019ve told everybody that these things would happen, because I\u2019ve seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody \u2014 in many cases, totally unsolicited.\n\r\n\r\n This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they\u2019re eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they\u2019re just taking numbers. They\u2019re writing down things \u2014 the workers \u2014 and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you\u2019ll see that will shake even you people up, and you\u2019ve seen it all.\n\r\n\r\n The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you\u2019ve written about \u2014 and, for a long time, you\u2019ve been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s a long time ago, and it hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s gotten worse.\n\r\n\r\n In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don\u2019t have postmarks; you don\u2019t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place.\n\r\n\r\n So you don\u2019t have postmarks; you don\u2019t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say has the best reputation for election integrity.\n\r\n\r\n Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn\u2019t see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous.\n\r\n\r\n One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn\u2019t want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there.\n\r\n\r\n In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning and \u2014 even though the polls closed at eight o\u2019clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We\u2019ve also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia.\n\r\n\r\n In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name \u201cBiden\u201d on them, or just about all \u2014 I think almost all. They all had the name \u201cBiden\u201d on them, which is a little strange.\n\r\n\r\n I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word \u201clegal\u201d \u2014 \u201clegal votes.\u201d \u201cWe want every legal vote counted.\u201d And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency \u2014 no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day.\n\r\n\r\n You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. And they don\u2019t want votes cast after Election Day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It\u2019s so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it\u2019s a very important job.\n\r\n\r\n So that\u2019s the way this country is going to win. That\u2019s the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there\u2019s going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it\u2019s going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We\u2019ll see. But we think there\u2019ll be a lot of litigation because we can\u2019t have an election stolen by \u2014 like this.\n\r\n\r\n And I \u2014 I tell you, I would \u2014 I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I\u2019ve said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous.\n\r\n\r\n This is a large-scale version, and it\u2019s getting worse and worse every day. We\u2019re hearing stories that are horror stories \u2014 absolute horror stories. And we can\u2019t let that happen to the United States of America. It\u2019s not a question of who wins \u2014 Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can\u2019t let that happen to our country. We can\u2019t be disgraced by having something like this happen.\n\r\n\r\n So it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it\u2019ll probably go through a process \u2014 a legal process. And, as you know, I\u2019ve claimed certain states and he\u2019s claiming states. So we can both claim the states, but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there\u2019s been a lot of shenanigans, and we can\u2019t stand for that in our country.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you very much.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good evening.

They put paper on all of the windows so you can\u2019t see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day \u2014 that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren\u2019t. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn\u2019t do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That\u2019s why they did the mail-in ballots, where there\u2019s tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That\u2019s why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I\u2019ve told everybody that these things would happen, because I\u2019ve seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody \u2014 in many cases, totally unsolicited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they\u2019re eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they\u2019re just taking numbers. They\u2019re writing down things \u2014 the workers \u2014 and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you\u2019ll see that will shake even you people up, and you\u2019ve seen it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you\u2019ve written about \u2014 and, for a long time, you\u2019ve been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s a long time ago, and it hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s gotten worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don\u2019t have postmarks; you don\u2019t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you don\u2019t have postmarks; you don\u2019t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say has the best reputation for election integrity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn\u2019t see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn\u2019t want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning and \u2014 even though the polls closed at eight o\u2019clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We\u2019ve also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name \u201cBiden\u201d on them, or just about all \u2014 I think almost all. They all had the name \u201cBiden\u201d on them, which is a little strange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word \u201clegal\u201d \u2014 \u201clegal votes.\u201d \u201cWe want every legal vote counted.\u201d And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency \u2014 no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. And they don\u2019t want votes cast after Election Day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It\u2019s so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it\u2019s a very important job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that\u2019s the way this country is going to win. That\u2019s the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there\u2019s going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it\u2019s going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We\u2019ll see. But we think there\u2019ll be a lot of litigation because we can\u2019t have an election stolen by \u2014 like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I \u2014 I tell you, I would \u2014 I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I\u2019ve said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a large-scale version, and it\u2019s getting worse and worse every day. We\u2019re hearing stories that are horror stories \u2014 absolute horror stories. And we can\u2019t let that happen to the United States of America. It\u2019s not a question of who wins \u2014 Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can\u2019t let that happen to our country. We can\u2019t be disgraced by having something like this happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it\u2019ll probably go through a process \u2014 a legal process. And, as you know, I\u2019ve claimed certain states and he\u2019s claiming states. So we can both claim the states, but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there\u2019s been a lot of shenanigans, and we can\u2019t stand for that in our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Trump_Remarks_on_2020_Election.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Trump makes remarks at the White House Press Briefing room about the 2020 election.
