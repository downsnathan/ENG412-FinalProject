    "transcript": "GENTLEMAN, \n The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good  as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist Association, give  me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit  of the interests of my constituents, and in proportion as they are persuaded  of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more  pleasing. \n Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man  and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship,  that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions,  I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people  which declared that their legislature should &quot;make no law respecting an  establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&quot; thus  building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression  of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall  see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to  restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in  opposition to his social duties. \n I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common  Father and Creator of man, and tender you for yourselves and your religious  association, assurances of my high respect and esteem.",

    "president": "Thomas Jefferson",
    "introduction": "Responding to a supportive letter from the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut, Jefferson admires the \"wall of separation between church and state\" established by the First Amendment. The President wanted to reprimand the large number of clerics that mixed religion and politics in that part of the nation, especially those that publicly opposed his beliefs on the subject. "
