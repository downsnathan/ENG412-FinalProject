{"president": "Donald Trump", "doc_name": "june-20-2020-campaign-rally-tulsa-oklahoma", "date": "2020-06-20T19:00:00-04:00", "title": "June 20, 2020: Campaign Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma", "transcript": "Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I\u2019ve been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don\u2019t go, don\u2019t come, don\u2019t do anything. Today it was like, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we\u2019re doing very well in Oklahoma, that\u2019s the word. That\u2019s the word.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we\u2019re going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We\u2019re going to stop the radical left. We\u2019re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we\u2019ve done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that\u2019s an all-time record. That\u2019s an all-time record. I\u2019ve always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we\u2019re going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd.\n\r\n\r\n And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they\u2019re great. They are, they\u2019re great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We\u2019ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it\u2019s submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it\u2019s all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where\u2019s my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he\u2019s running, he\u2019s great.\n\r\n\r\n But we\u2019ll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you\u2019re a veteran, for years and years, they\u2019ve wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you\u2019re a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It\u2019s never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that\u2019s how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number.\n\r\n\r\n And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn\u2019t love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn\u2019t get rid of them because they were, let\u2019s say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let\u2019s say, let\u2019s just say. And so you couldn\u2019t get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I\u2019m going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you\u2019re fired, get out, right? Get out.\n\r\n\r\n They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening, I never knew it was so deep. It\u2019s deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We\u2019re lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I\u2019ve been saying it for a long time.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I\u2019m old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn\u2019t lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He\u2019s in Iowa and he says it\u2019s good to be in Idaho. No, no, you\u2019re in Iowa. He\u2019s in New Hampshire and he says it\u2019s great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you\u2019re in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn\u2019t happened to me yet. When that happens, there\u2019s nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy superpower of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia.\n\r\n\r\n I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That\u2019s called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That\u2019s OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you\u2019re going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child\u2019s play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it\u2019s called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody.\n\r\n\r\n Our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left. We just saw it outside. We just saw it outside, you saw these thugs that came along. These people, call them protesters, isn\u2019t it beautiful, it\u2019s so beautiful. No, they\u2019re so wonderful. They call them the Boston Tea Party. They\u2019re so wonderful. Yeah, they call them \u2026 You ever watch fake news, CNN, you ever watch?&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he\u2019s standing in front of a building saying, \u201cthings are very peaceful here.\u201d And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I\u2019ve ever seen. The whole town is burning. It\u2019s like the biggest fire. And he said, \u201cThings are very good here, Anderson. I think it\u2019s great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\u201d Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \u201cYou got to get \u2026 you can\u2019t protect yourselves.\u201d I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour, it all ended, and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem.\n\r\n\r\n And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn\u2019t that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we\u2019re not talking about some little place, we\u2019re talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who\u2019s radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I\u2019d have an offer out, I said, \u201cAnytime you want we\u2019ll come in, we\u2019ll straighten it out in one hour or less.\u201d Now I may be wrong, but it\u2019s probably better for us to just watch that disaster.\n\r\n\r\n I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we\u2019re going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \u201cCongressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\u201d But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don\u2019t complain. They\u2019re incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don\u2019t talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they\u2019re not wearing their mask. You don\u2019t hear their say, as they\u2019re breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \u201cWhat a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n But you don\u2019t hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don\u2019t ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we\u2019re terrible. And what we\u2019ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double-edged sword. We\u2019ve tested now 25 million people. It\u2019s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany\u2019s done a lot. South Korea has done a lot.\n\r\n\r\n They called me, they said, the job you\u2019re doing \u2026 Here\u2019s the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to find more people, you\u2019re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man\u2019s 10-years-old. He\u2019s got the sniffles. He\u2019ll recover in about 15 minutes. That\u2019s a case, add him to it. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he\u2019s very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that\u2019s amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us.\n\r\n\r\n When you see a little kid running around say, \u201cBoy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\u201d They don\u2019t even know about this. Let\u2019s open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We\u2019re not conforming, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that.\n\r\n\r\n And I heard it for the first time two weeks ago, I said, \u201cWell, that one, I mean, they\u2019re only kidding.\u201d I said, \u201cThey\u2019re only, they\u2019re not.\u201d Minneapolis, you see what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re not kidding. They got a lot of problems. They\u2019ll have a lot of problems. Hey, it\u2019s 1:00 o\u2019clock in the morning and a very tough, I\u2019ve used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this number\u2019s no longer working.\u201d By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it\u2019s a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you\u2019re sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council\u2019s already passed it. In Seattle, you see what\u2019s going on there, it\u2019s even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They\u2019re crazy.\n\r\n\r\n So if you want to save your heritage, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We\u2019re a great country. You are so lucky I\u2019m president, that\u2019s all I can tell you.\n\r\n\r\n People have come up to me, say, \u201cHow do you take it?\u201d I say, \u201cDo I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\u201d We deal with a lot of bad people, but we\u2019re winning. And every once in a while, I\u2019ll have one of these days where I\u2019m hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \u201cOh, it\u2019s COVID.\u201d It\u2019s this again. By the way, it\u2019s a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \u201cKung flu.\u201d I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \u201cWhere do you get the energy?\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might\u2019ve seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \u201cSir, West Point, West Point, we\u2019re ready.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n You know, they delayed it for six weeks because of COVID. So they delayed it and I went there. 1,106 cadets were graduated and beautiful. Beautiful cadets. Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \u201cSir, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d I say, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it\u2019s beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \u201cSir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\u201d So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don\u2019t know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don\u2019t know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay.\n\r\n\r\n But they said to me before the speech, \u201cSir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there\u2019ll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\u201d Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it\u2019s like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought.\n\r\n\r\n Helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought. So they fly over and the kids throw the hats in the air, it\u2019s beautiful, it really is. It was a beautiful day and we\u2019re all finished. I was on the stage for hours, hours, sun, I came home, I had a nice tan, meaning I had a nice sunburn. The sun\u2019s gone right like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I\u2019m off by two minutes they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he\u2019s a liar.\u201d These people are sick, the fake news.\n\r\n\r\n So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \u201cThank goodness. Thank you very much.\u201d Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \u201cSir, are you ready?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready General, where are we going now?\u201d You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it\u2019s sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \u201cSir, we can now leave the stage.\u201d I said, \u201cGreat general, let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll follow you,\u201d and he goes like this, \u201cRight here, sir,\u201d and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \u201cGeneral.\u201d Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They\u2019re incredible, and they do. I said, \u201cGeneral, I\u2019ve got myself a problem, general.\u201d Because I\u2019m wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you\u2019re walking on flat surfaces. It\u2019s not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \u201cGeneral, I have a problem,\u201d and he didn\u2019t understand that at first. I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201d He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I\u2019m being baked. I\u2019m being baked like a cake. I said, \u201cGeneral, there\u2019s no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s true. So I said, \u201cIs there like something else around?\u201d \u201cSir, the ramp is ready to go.\u201d \u201cGrab me sir, grab me.\u201d I didn\u2019t really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \u201cThat will be a story too.\u201d So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I\u2019m rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \u2026 It\u2019s an ice skating rink, it\u2019s brutal. So I said, \u201cGeneral, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\u201d Because I can\u2019t fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It\u2019s true, right? \u201cI don\u2019t want that, general.\u201d Now he\u2019s standing there, big strong guy, and he\u2019s got these shoes but they\u2019re loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \u201cOkay, general, let\u2019s go. I will only grab you if I need you. That\u2019s not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn\u2019t like that. I didn\u2019t like this picture. This picture I\u2019m sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \u201cGeneral, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn\u2019t want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \u201cHere was the number one trending story.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n I call my wife, I said, \u201cHow good was that speech? I thought it was a \u2026\u201d Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I\u2019m average, but we\u2019re having fun, we\u2019re having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \u201cHow good was it, darling?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019re trending number one.\u201d I said to our great first lady, I said, \u201cLet me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I\u2019m trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\u201d No, no, they don\u2019t even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson\u2019s disease. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true.\n\r\n\r\n They say there is something wrong with our president. I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s something wrong, okay? I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s something, I\u2019ll tell you what, there\u2019s something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you.\n\r\n\r\n So then my wife said, \u201cWell it wasn\u2019t only the ramp. Did you have water?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn\u2019t want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\u201d You\u2019re drinking, you\u2019re working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun\u2019s like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That\u2019s why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \u201cWhat does it have to do with water?\u201d They said, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\u201d I said, \u201cI just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201d She said, \u201cWell I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that\u2019s sort of expensive.\u201d It\u2019s silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don\u2019t want to get water on the tie, and I don\u2019t want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water.\n\r\n\r\n I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? Where did it come from? I look down at my tie because I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve taken water and it spills down onto your tie, doesn\u2019t look good for a long time and frankly, the tie is never the same. So I put it up to my lip and then I say, and they gave me another disease. They gave me another disease. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story, but here\u2019s the story. I have lived with more the ramp than the water but I have lived with the ramp and the water since I left West Point. Not one media group said I made a good speech or I made a great speech, but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier which wasn\u2019t good in terms of COVID but they broke their barrier and they wanted to shake hands, they wanted to \u2026 I don\u2019t want to tell anybody, but there were a couple of kids, they put out their hand, I actually shook their hand, okay? I actually shook them. Because they were excited. They were excited. They were with their president. They were excited. The most beautiful young people. Men, women, the most beautiful young people you\u2019ve ever seen. So think of how you feel if you\u2019re me. I go there, how did I do? \u201cSir, that was a great speech.\u201d You know all my people, \u201cSir, that was one of your best, that was great.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I agree, it was a good speech. I like that speech.\u201d They don\u2019t mention the speech but they have been going down this ramp at an inch at a time. It\u2019s so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They\u2019re bad people. Bad people.\n\r\n\r\n Okay, that\u2019s enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we\u2019re getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn\u2019t have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn\u2019t do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we\u2019re very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it.\n\r\n\r\n You know they talk about freedom of speech and I\u2019m a big believer in freedom of speech, but that\u2019s desecration, that\u2019s a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don\u2019t have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \u201cOh, the protesters were lovely.\u201d Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They\u2019d have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they\u2019ve done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they\u2019re wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I\u2019ll help you, I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I\u2019m waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it\u2019ll take less than an hour and it\u2019ll all be over with and you\u2019ll have your city back.\n\r\n\r\n Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he\u2019s not confusing her with his sister? \u201cGet me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\u201d That\u2019s what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I\u2019ll make like a speech and I\u2019ll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn\u2019t \u2026 It\u2019ll say, \u201cA comment from Joe Biden,\u201d but he didn\u2019t say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they\u2019ll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \u201cJoe didn\u2019t say that. Joe doesn\u2019t even understand it.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n If Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters 100%. Your 401(k)s, by the way, look at how we\u2019re doing in the stock market. Just set another record with NASDAQ. NASDAQ. Your 401(k)s and money itself will be worthless. Your 401(k)s are doing very well unless I don\u2019t want to say \u2026 If you were stupid I\u2019d say, \u201cDon\u2019t sell. Don\u2019t sell. It went down.\u201d But we got it back up, and now NASDAQ, think of it. NASDAQ just set a record and I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of records, and next year, if we don\u2019t do anything stupid on November 3, you are going to have the greatest economic year we\u2019ve ever had. That will be next year. If the Democrats gain power, than the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left, and he\u2019s not radical left. I don\u2019t think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he\u2019s controlled by the radical left, and now he\u2019s really controlled. His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. They bailed them out, they put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters, the looters and they were, they were the arsonists. They\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s terrible what he says about the people of our nation.\u201d Maybe some of them aren\u2019t even from our nation.\n\r\n\r\n The leftists try to do everything they can to stop us. Every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem, they\u2019ll do anything they can to stop us. Look what happened tonight. Look at what happened tonight. Law enforcement said, \u201cSir, they can\u2019t be outside. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people. Our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side. Because I know our people. I know our people, but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation. What they did tonight, I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets. You open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions. It\u2019s a great plane. Great everything. By the way, we ordered new ones. No president wanted to do it. They thought it was luxurious so wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don\u2019t realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \u201cSir, would you sign for this plane?\u201d Now it\u2019s actually two planes. \u201cWould you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\u201d I said, \u201cHow old is the original or the one we have now?\u201d \u201cSir, it\u2019s 31, 32 years.\u201d I\u2019d see people coming in from foreign lands that can\u2019t compete with us, rich countries but they can\u2019t compete with the \u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \u201cWait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \u2026\u201d\n\r\n\r\n So the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was $5.7 or $5.6 billion. Now in all fairness, it\u2019s two planes and there\u2019s a lot of stuff in those planes I won\u2019t talk to you about. So I told Boeing, the head of Boeing, they said, \u201cSir, please, we\u2019d like to get started on the planes,\u201d I said, \u201cI do too, but I\u2019m not paying $5.6 billion, and I\u2019m not paying $4.6 billion.\u201d I said, \u201cIt has to have a three on the front of it.\u201d That\u2019s a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation. They said, \u201cNo way. No way.\u201d This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing is coming back. They\u2019re coming back. Greatest company of the world and that\u2019s their big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn\u2019t work out. That was terrible, but the greatest. I think before that, it was the greatest company in the world. It made up a quarter, one quarter of a point, of our GDP. Think how big that is, one company. It was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they\u2019ve gone through hell but you know what? They\u2019re coming back, we\u2019re ready to help them if they need it but they\u2019re coming back in the coming and they\u2019re coming. This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we\u2019re still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \u201cNo, no, no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\u201d Whatever it was, if I\u2019m a little bit off they\u2019ll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \u201cCancel the contract. I want it canceled.\u201d I said, \u201cGeneral, can you cancel the contract?\u201d He said, \u201cYes sir, I\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d \u201cOh good. Cancel it.\u201d \u201cOkay sir.\u201d \u201cBy the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\u201d \u201cYes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\u201d \u201cHow much is it, general?\u201d \u201c$250 million.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\u201d \u201cYou mean if we don\u2019t buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\u201d That\u2019s not good, right? Look at these two guys, they\u2019re looking.\n\r\n\r\n By the way, that\u2019s like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \u201c$250 million?\u201d Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I\u2019m off by a little bit, they say, \u201cOh, he exaggerates.\u201d I look at numbers all day long. That\u2019s what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \u2026 I say, \u201cGeneral. Don\u2019t cancel. Don\u2019t cancel. Just tell them I don\u2019t want the planes. Don\u2019t put anything in writing, don\u2019t put it in writing, general.\u201d \u201cWhy sir?\u201d \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to pay 250.\u201d True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he\u2019s great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job.\n\r\n\r\n So here\u2019s what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \u201cNo way, no way, no way.\u201d The next week they say, \u201cNo way we\u2019re doing it.\u201d The next week they said, \u201cHow about $5 billion?\u201d I said, \u201cNo way. No way.\u201d The next week they said, \u201c$4.8.\u201d I said, \u201cNope. It\u2019s got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don\u2019t you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \u201c$4.5 is our best offer.\u201d \u201cNope. I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m not doing it. Come back when you\u2019re ready.\u201d A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion.\n\r\n\r\n That\u2019s a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they\u2019re not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s get it down from $50,000&nbsp;to $25,000&nbsp;because they\u2019re delinquent. For many years they\u2019re delinquent. They haven\u2019t been paying what they\u2019re supposed to be paying. They\u2019re paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\u201d and they say, \u201cYes, we think by\n\r\n\r\n And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \u201cNo, Angela, please. Don\u2019t say that Angela. It\u2019s true. You know who I\u2019m talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \u201cAngela, that\u2019s a long time,\u201d this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \u201cNo Angela, that\u2019s not working.\u201d But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \u201cWell, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\u201d Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn\u2019t paid. I said, \u201cWhat about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\u201d So we\u2019re negotiating let\u2019s see, but in the meantime, we\u2019re reducing our troops.\n\r\n\r\n Remember this, we\u2019re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we\u2019re supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We\u2019re supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don\u2019t get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We\u2019re ripped off by so many countries and we\u2019re stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don\u2019t want me here. They don\u2019t want me. There are a lot of people that don\u2019t want me. They don\u2019t sell a lot of bombs when we\u2019re not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It\u2019s called the military industrial complex.\n\r\n\r\n When rioting and looting broke out in our nation\u2019s Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \u201cGet them in.\u201d After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We\u2019re not happy. That\u2019s going to be very expensive for DC. They\u2019re always looking for money. \u201cWe need more money. We always need more money.\u201d And then they don\u2019t do the proper job. So it\u2019s not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there.\n\r\n\r\n They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don\u2019t worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 2020 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn\u2019t like what he said a week ago. I said, \u201cWhere did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody\u2019s even asking?\u201d We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn\u2019t like that. A lot of people that you wouldn\u2019t even think would care that much. I\u2019ve had people that I said, \u201cThese are super left liberals and they didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we\u2019re doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody\u2019s coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you\u2019ve ever seen or ever heard.\n\r\n\r\n Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they\u2019re not looking to do you much help. ICE, they\u2019re rough guys. they\u2019re great Americans, but they\u2019ll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They\u2019ll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn\u2019t say this, it\u2019s not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody\u2019s swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They\u2019re great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth.\n\r\n\r\n And when I called them animals, I said, \u201cThey\u2019re animals.\u201d And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it\u2019s more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \u201cThese are animals.\u201d And Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cThese are human beings. They\u2019re not animals.\u201d If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden\u2019s America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that\u2019s true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you\u2019re seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don\u2019t keep them out.\n\r\n\r\n We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden\u2019s record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what\u2019s great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He\u2019s been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden\u2019s supported every globalist attack on the American worker let\u2019s make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry.\n\r\n\r\n Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \u201cWe have to make this deal with South Korea. It\u2019s going to mean 250,000 jobs.\u201d And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens.\n\r\n\r\n When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn\u2019t know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn\u2019t say it. And they didn\u2019t cover it. They didn\u2019t cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that\u2019s closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That\u2019s early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID.\n\r\n\r\n When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He\u2019ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That\u2019s been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world\u2019s top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn\u2019t like it. You know why he didn\u2019t like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn\u2019t work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it\u2019s a little bit\u2026\n\r\n\r\n Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they\u2019re paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they\u2019re okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That\u2019s incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that\u2019s why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing.\n\r\n\r\n And almost more incredible, he gave him 1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they\u2019re not doing so well, are they? They\u2019re not doing so well. Someday, we\u2019re going to get credit for this, someday, but they are waiting. Iran wants to make a deal so badly. But they\u2019re told by Kerry and all these other, they shouldn\u2019t the Logan Act, but they\u2019re told Kerry and all these people, \u201cWait, because if Trump loses, you\u2019ll own America, you\u2019re going to own it.\u201d They\u2019ll say you own it. So I don\u2019t mind. I told them we can wait, but when I win, you\u2019re going to pay a much higher price than if you made a deal now, it\u2019s true.\n\r\n\r\n I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son\u2019s paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full-scale assault on American life. You know that. They\u2019ll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that\u2019s perfect and they\u2019re not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don\u2019t want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution.\n\r\n\r\n They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O\u2019Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won\u2019t have to think back about it too much, because it won\u2019t matter. Hopefully it won\u2019t matter. No, Beto O\u2019Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that\u2019s not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it\u2019s never been before. And that\u2019s after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far.\n\r\n\r\n And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn\u2019t have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it\u2019s a, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an equal court, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a minority court, right? It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We\u2019ll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you\u2019re the elite. They\u2019re not the elite. You\u2019re the elite.\n\r\n\r\n Somebody two days ago said, \u201cSir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, why do you call them the elite,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy?\u201d \u201cWell, they\u2019re not elite.\u201d I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we\u2019ll do it one more time. We won\u2019t even toy with them about three or four more times. We won\u2019t. We\u2019ll do it one more time. We\u2019ll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger.\n\r\n\r\n But I\u2019ll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I\u2019ll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I\u2019ll only pick from that list. Biden can\u2019t release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn\u2019t be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don\u2019t understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \u201cYou won, but you have to come back and redo it.\u201d It\u2019s almost like, \u201cGee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\u201d But we\u2019re going to be refiling, but don\u2019t let it get you. Everything\u2019s going to work out really good. Everything\u2019s going to work out good.\n\r\n\r\n It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to win DACA. You\u2019re going to win DACA. That\u2019s easy. You got to win DACA. That\u2019s easy.\u201d They all said it. And they came back and they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like what you did with your paperwork,\u201d essentially. So we\u2019re re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn\u2019t lose. We\u2019re going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren\u2019t so young anymore, by the way. But we\u2019re going to work it out for everybody.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn\u2019t even know where the hell he is. Let\u2019s face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work out too well, but she\u2019s actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn\u2019t even want to win. She doesn\u2019t want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she\u2019s got no sense, no credentials. She\u2019s got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn\u2019t have a clue. You know it. But she\u2019s in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let\u2019s cancel those brand new Air Force Ones.\n\r\n\r\n Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate-filled, America-bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don\u2019t think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she\u2019s telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we\u2019re going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they\u2019ve had it. They\u2019ve had it.\n\r\n\r\n Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man\u2019s personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he\u2019s never met. And he frankly probably doesn\u2019t want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else\u2019s jobs too by the way. If I didn\u2019t come along, we\u2019re building auto plants, we\u2019re building everything. And there\u2019s never been a comeback like we\u2019re making right now. Never been.\n\r\n\r\n He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn\u2019t wanted to\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don\u2019t-\n\r\n\r\n And they don\u2019t want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They\u2019re not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They\u2019ve done a terrible job and they shouldn\u2019t be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn\u2019t happen. It\u2019ll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We\u2019ve all worked too hard. They don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I\u2019ve done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.\n\r\n\r\n Racial justice begins with Joe Biden\u2019s retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They\u2019re respected by everybody. They do some job, and I\u2019d have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He\u2019s running on November 3rd. I don\u2019t even know. Does he\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\u2026 There\u2019s no competition that he\u2019s got. I know he\u2019s got James\u2019 support. He\u2019s got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I\u2019d give it to James too, but he\u2019s not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is.\n\r\n\r\n Also here is a man who\u2019s respected by so many. He\u2019s a little bit right of the people we\u2019ve been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you, Tom. Great job you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re glad to be joined as well by a man that I\u2019ve gotten to know. He\u2019s done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He\u2019s been here for a little while. He\u2019s done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don\u2019t want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I\u2019ll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they\u2019ve done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible.\n\r\n\r\n David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who\u2019s got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They\u2019re great\u2026 They are, they\u2019re warriors. I\u2019ll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we\u2019ll send Jim Inhofe back, and we\u2019ll send all of them. You\u2019ll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they\u2019ve been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much.\n\r\n\r\n So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I\u2019m right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody\u2019s ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re doing it again. And it\u2019s going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don\u2019t quite get it. We\u2019re doing record business. It\u2019s happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe.\n\r\n\r\n Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn\u2019t stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re going up. We\u2019re going up. We\u2019re going up. We\u2019re going to go up. Then we\u2019re going to hit October. We\u2019re going to be up. We\u2019re going to be way up. We\u2019re not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China.\n\r\n\r\n But we\u2019re going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \u201cMan, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t believe the fake news anymore.\u201d And you\u2019re not going to want to lose your 401k\u2019s. And you\u2019re not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you\u2019ve accumulated, whether it\u2019s real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it\u2019ll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I\u2019m not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we\u2019re going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we\u2019ve ever had, okay?\n\r\n\r\n And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don\u2019t have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don\u2019t have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \u201cWait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don\u2019t think I want to take a chance.\u201d You\u2019re not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50-day period, it\u2019s the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \u201cDarling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\u201d And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \u201cDarling, I love you so much. You\u2019ve always been a loser. You\u2019ve always lost money. But now under President Trump, you\u2019re one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\u201d And all you did was keep your stock.\n\r\n\r\n Now, if you think you\u2019re going to run against\u2026 Oh, they\u2019re going crazy. They want the stock market to go down. Even if it costs them money, they want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money, and they don\u2019t even know why. You know what, they\u2019re smart and they\u2019re vicious, but they don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m telling you, they don\u2019t know why. What\u2019s wrong with having the strongest military brand new in the world [inaudible]? What\u2019s wrong with having these great economic numbers? What\u2019s wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let\u2019s go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He\u2019s a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it\u2019s time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work.\n\r\n\r\n I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they\u2019ve never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I\u2019m also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we\u2019re going to do that. It\u2019ll be done very quickly.\n\r\n\r\n We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice, pro choice for schools. It\u2019s very popular, but some people it\u2019s like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it\u2019s wrong.\n\r\n\r\n Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It\u2019s a civil right. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that\u2019s over 30%. They\u2019re controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats\u2019 push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you\u2019d never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\n\r\n\r\n A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they\u2019d see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we\u2019ll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities.\n\r\n\r\n We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful, 212 miles. That\u2019s a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there\u2019s something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \u201cJust leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\u201d I said, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It\u2019s so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That\u2019s happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn\u2019t President, would have never come. We will become the world\u2019s premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That\u2019s already started. We\u2019re bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America\u2019s terrorist enemies.\n\r\n\r\n When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \u201cSir, we\u2019ve just taken 100%.\u201d&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it\u2019s damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn\u2019t sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we\u2019ll protect your second amendment.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \u201cIn God we trust.\u201d We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.\n\r\n\r\n We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n &nbsp;", "transcript_html": "<p>Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I\u2019ve been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don\u2019t go, don\u2019t come, don\u2019t do anything. Today it was like, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we\u2019re doing very well in Oklahoma, that\u2019s the word. That\u2019s the word.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we\u2019re going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We\u2019re going to stop the radical left. We\u2019re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln, and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we\u2019ve done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that\u2019s an all-time record. That\u2019s an all-time record. I\u2019ve always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we\u2019re going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they\u2019re great. They are, they\u2019re great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We\u2019ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it\u2019s submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it\u2019s all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where\u2019s my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he\u2019s running, he\u2019s great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we\u2019ll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you\u2019re a veteran, for years and years, they\u2019ve wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you\u2019re a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It\u2019s never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that\u2019s how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn\u2019t love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn\u2019t get rid of them because they were, let\u2019s say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let\u2019s say, let\u2019s just say. And so you couldn\u2019t get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I\u2019m going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you\u2019re fired, get out, right? Get out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening, I never knew it was so deep. It\u2019s deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We\u2019re lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I\u2019ve been saying it for a long time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I\u2019m old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn\u2019t lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He\u2019s in Iowa and he says it\u2019s good to be in Idaho. No, no, you\u2019re in Iowa. He\u2019s in New Hampshire and he says it\u2019s great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you\u2019re in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn\u2019t happened to me yet. When that happens, there\u2019s nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy superpower of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That\u2019s called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That\u2019s OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you\u2019re going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child\u2019s play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it\u2019s called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left. We just saw it outside. We just saw it outside, you saw these thugs that came along. These people, call them protesters, isn\u2019t it beautiful, it\u2019s so beautiful. No, they\u2019re so wonderful. They call them the Boston Tea Party. They\u2019re so wonderful. Yeah, they call them \u2026 You ever watch fake news, CNN, you ever watch?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he\u2019s standing in front of a building saying, \u201cthings are very peaceful here.\u201d And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I\u2019ve ever seen. The whole town is burning. It\u2019s like the biggest fire. And he said, \u201cThings are very good here, Anderson. I think it\u2019s great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\u201d Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \u201cYou got to get \u2026 you can\u2019t protect yourselves.\u201d I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour, it all ended, and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn\u2019t that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we\u2019re not talking about some little place, we\u2019re talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who\u2019s radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I\u2019d have an offer out, I said, \u201cAnytime you want we\u2019ll come in, we\u2019ll straighten it out in one hour or less.\u201d Now I may be wrong, but it\u2019s probably better for us to just watch that disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we\u2019re going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \u201cCongressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\u201d But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don\u2019t complain. They\u2019re incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don\u2019t talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they\u2019re not wearing their mask. You don\u2019t hear their say, as they\u2019re breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \u201cWhat a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you don\u2019t hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don\u2019t ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we\u2019re terrible. And what we\u2019ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double-edged sword. We\u2019ve tested now 25 million people. It\u2019s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany\u2019s done a lot. South Korea has done a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They called me, they said, the job you\u2019re doing \u2026 Here\u2019s the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to find more people, you\u2019re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man\u2019s 10-years-old. He\u2019s got the sniffles. He\u2019ll recover in about 15 minutes. That\u2019s a case, add him to it. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he\u2019s very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that\u2019s amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you see a little kid running around say, \u201cBoy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\u201d They don\u2019t even know about this. Let\u2019s open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We\u2019re not conforming, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I heard it for the first time two weeks ago, I said, \u201cWell, that one, I mean, they\u2019re only kidding.\u201d I said, \u201cThey\u2019re only, they\u2019re not.\u201d Minneapolis, you see what\u2019s going on. They\u2019re not kidding. They got a lot of problems. They\u2019ll have a lot of problems. Hey, it\u2019s 1:00 o\u2019clock in the morning and a very tough, I\u2019ve used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this number\u2019s no longer working.\u201d By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it\u2019s a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you\u2019re sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council\u2019s already passed it. In Seattle, you see what\u2019s going on there, it\u2019s even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They\u2019re crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you want to save your heritage, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We\u2019re a great country. You are so lucky I\u2019m president, that\u2019s all I can tell you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People have come up to me, say, \u201cHow do you take it?\u201d I say, \u201cDo I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\u201d We deal with a lot of bad people, but we\u2019re winning. And every once in a while, I\u2019ll have one of these days where I\u2019m hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \u201cOh, it\u2019s COVID.\u201d It\u2019s this again. By the way, it\u2019s a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \u201cKung flu.\u201d I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \u201cWhere do you get the energy?\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice. I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might\u2019ve seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \u201cSir, West Point, West Point, we\u2019re ready.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, they delayed it for six weeks because of COVID. So they delayed it and I went there. 1,106 cadets were graduated and beautiful. Beautiful cadets. Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \u201cSir, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d I say, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it\u2019s beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \u201cSir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\u201d So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don\u2019t know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don\u2019t know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they said to me before the speech, \u201cSir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there\u2019ll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\u201d Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it\u2019s like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought. So they fly over and the kids throw the hats in the air, it\u2019s beautiful, it really is. It was a beautiful day and we\u2019re all finished. I was on the stage for hours, hours, sun, I came home, I had a nice tan, meaning I had a nice sunburn. The sun\u2019s gone right like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I\u2019m off by two minutes they\u2019ll say, \u201cHe exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he\u2019s a liar.\u201d These people are sick, the fake news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \u201cThank goodness. Thank you very much.\u201d Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \u201cSir, are you ready?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m ready General, where are we going now?\u201d You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it\u2019s sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \u201cSir, we can now leave the stage.\u201d I said, \u201cGreat general, let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll follow you,\u201d and he goes like this, \u201cRight here, sir,\u201d and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \u201cGeneral.\u201d Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They\u2019re incredible, and they do. I said, \u201cGeneral, I\u2019ve got myself a problem, general.\u201d Because I\u2019m wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you\u2019re walking on flat surfaces. It\u2019s not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \u201cGeneral, I have a problem,\u201d and he didn\u2019t understand that at first. I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way.\u201d He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I\u2019m being baked. I\u2019m being baked like a cake. I said, \u201cGeneral, there\u2019s no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s true. So I said, \u201cIs there like something else around?\u201d \u201cSir, the ramp is ready to go.\u201d \u201cGrab me sir, grab me.\u201d I didn\u2019t really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \u201cThat will be a story too.\u201d So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I\u2019m rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \u2026 It\u2019s an ice skating rink, it\u2019s brutal. So I said, \u201cGeneral, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\u201d Because I can\u2019t fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It\u2019s true, right? \u201cI don\u2019t want that, general.\u201d Now he\u2019s standing there, big strong guy, and he\u2019s got these shoes but they\u2019re loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \u201cOkay, general, let\u2019s go. I will only grab you if I need you. That\u2019s not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn\u2019t like that. I didn\u2019t like this picture. This picture I\u2019m sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \u201cGeneral, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn\u2019t want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \u201cHere was the number one trending story.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I call my wife, I said, \u201cHow good was that speech? I thought it was a \u2026\u201d Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I\u2019m average, but we\u2019re having fun, we\u2019re having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \u201cHow good was it, darling?\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019re trending number one.\u201d I said to our great first lady, I said, \u201cLet me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I\u2019m trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\u201d No, no, they don\u2019t even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson\u2019s disease. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They say there is something wrong with our president. I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s something wrong, okay? I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s something, I\u2019ll tell you what, there\u2019s something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So then my wife said, \u201cWell it wasn\u2019t only the ramp. Did you have water?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn\u2019t want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\u201d You\u2019re drinking, you\u2019re working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun\u2019s like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That\u2019s why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \u201cWhat does it have to do with water?\u201d They said, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\u201d I said, \u201cI just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201d She said, \u201cWell I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that\u2019s sort of expensive.\u201d It\u2019s silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don\u2019t want to get water on the tie, and I don\u2019t want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? Where did it come from? I look down at my tie because I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve taken water and it spills down onto your tie, doesn\u2019t look good for a long time and frankly, the tie is never the same. So I put it up to my lip and then I say, and they gave me another disease. They gave me another disease. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story, but here\u2019s the story. I have lived with more the ramp than the water but I have lived with the ramp and the water since I left West Point. Not one media group said I made a good speech or I made a great speech, but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier which wasn\u2019t good in terms of COVID but they broke their barrier and they wanted to shake hands, they wanted to \u2026 I don\u2019t want to tell anybody, but there were a couple of kids, they put out their hand, I actually shook their hand, okay? I actually shook them. Because they were excited. They were excited. They were with their president. They were excited. The most beautiful young people. Men, women, the most beautiful young people you\u2019ve ever seen. So think of how you feel if you\u2019re me. I go there, how did I do? \u201cSir, that was a great speech.\u201d You know all my people, \u201cSir, that was one of your best, that was great.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s great, I agree, it was a good speech. I like that speech.\u201d They don\u2019t mention the speech but they have been going down this ramp at an inch at a time. It\u2019s so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They\u2019re bad people. Bad people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, that\u2019s enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we\u2019re getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn\u2019t have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn\u2019t do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we\u2019re very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know they talk about freedom of speech and I\u2019m a big believer in freedom of speech, but that\u2019s desecration, that\u2019s a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don\u2019t have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \u201cOh, the protesters were lovely.\u201d Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They\u2019d have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they\u2019ve done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they\u2019re wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I\u2019ll help you, I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I\u2019m waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it\u2019ll take less than an hour and it\u2019ll all be over with and you\u2019ll have your city back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he\u2019s not confusing her with his sister? \u201cGet me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\u201d That\u2019s what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I\u2019ll make like a speech and I\u2019ll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn\u2019t \u2026 It\u2019ll say, \u201cA comment from Joe Biden,\u201d but he didn\u2019t say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they\u2019ll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \u201cJoe didn\u2019t say that. Joe doesn\u2019t even understand it.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters 100%. Your 401(k)s, by the way, look at how we\u2019re doing in the stock market. Just set another record with NASDAQ. NASDAQ. Your 401(k)s and money itself will be worthless. Your 401(k)s are doing very well unless I don\u2019t want to say \u2026 If you were stupid I\u2019d say, \u201cDon\u2019t sell. Don\u2019t sell. It went down.\u201d But we got it back up, and now NASDAQ, think of it. NASDAQ just set a record and I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of records, and next year, if we don\u2019t do anything stupid on November 3, you are going to have the greatest economic year we\u2019ve ever had. That will be next year. If the Democrats gain power, than the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left, and he\u2019s not radical left. I don\u2019t think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he\u2019s controlled by the radical left, and now he\u2019s really controlled. His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. They bailed them out, they put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters, the looters and they were, they were the arsonists. They\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s terrible what he says about the people of our nation.\u201d Maybe some of them aren\u2019t even from our nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leftists try to do everything they can to stop us. Every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem, they\u2019ll do anything they can to stop us. Look what happened tonight. Look at what happened tonight. Law enforcement said, \u201cSir, they can\u2019t be outside. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people. Our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side. Because I know our people. I know our people, but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation. What they did tonight, I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets. You open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions. It\u2019s a great plane. Great everything. By the way, we ordered new ones. No president wanted to do it. They thought it was luxurious so wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don\u2019t realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \u201cSir, would you sign for this plane?\u201d Now it\u2019s actually two planes. \u201cWould you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\u201d I said, \u201cHow old is the original or the one we have now?\u201d \u201cSir, it\u2019s 31, 32 years.\u201d I\u2019d see people coming in from foreign lands that can\u2019t compete with us, rich countries but they can\u2019t compete with the \u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \u201cWait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \u2026\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was $5.7 or $5.6 billion. Now in all fairness, it\u2019s two planes and there\u2019s a lot of stuff in those planes I won\u2019t talk to you about. So I told Boeing, the head of Boeing, they said, \u201cSir, please, we\u2019d like to get started on the planes,\u201d I said, \u201cI do too, but I\u2019m not paying $5.6 billion, and I\u2019m not paying $4.6 billion.\u201d I said, \u201cIt has to have a three on the front of it.\u201d That\u2019s a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation. They said, \u201cNo way. No way.\u201d This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing is coming back. They\u2019re coming back. Greatest company of the world and that\u2019s their big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn\u2019t work out. That was terrible, but the greatest. I think before that, it was the greatest company in the world. It made up a quarter, one quarter of a point, of our GDP. Think how big that is, one company. It was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they\u2019ve gone through hell but you know what? They\u2019re coming back, we\u2019re ready to help them if they need it but they\u2019re coming back in the coming and they\u2019re coming. This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we\u2019re still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \u201cNo, no, no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\u201d Whatever it was, if I\u2019m a little bit off they\u2019ll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \u201cCancel the contract. I want it canceled.\u201d I said, \u201cGeneral, can you cancel the contract?\u201d He said, \u201cYes sir, I\u2019m very proud of it.\u201d \u201cOh good. Cancel it.\u201d \u201cOkay sir.\u201d \u201cBy the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\u201d \u201cYes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\u201d \u201cHow much is it, general?\u201d \u201c$250 million.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\u201d \u201cYou mean if we don\u2019t buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\u201d That\u2019s not good, right? Look at these two guys, they\u2019re looking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, that\u2019s like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \u201c$250 million?\u201d Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I\u2019m off by a little bit, they say, \u201cOh, he exaggerates.\u201d I look at numbers all day long. That\u2019s what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \u2026 I say, \u201cGeneral. Don\u2019t cancel. Don\u2019t cancel. Just tell them I don\u2019t want the planes. Don\u2019t put anything in writing, don\u2019t put it in writing, general.\u201d \u201cWhy sir?\u201d \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to pay 250.\u201d True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he\u2019s great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here\u2019s what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \u201cNo way, no way, no way.\u201d The next week they say, \u201cNo way we\u2019re doing it.\u201d The next week they said, \u201cHow about $5 billion?\u201d I said, \u201cNo way. No way.\u201d The next week they said, \u201c$4.8.\u201d I said, \u201cNope. It\u2019s got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don\u2019t you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \u201c$4.5 is our best offer.\u201d \u201cNope. I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m not doing it. Come back when you\u2019re ready.\u201d A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\u2019s a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they\u2019re not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s get it down from $50,000&nbsp;to $25,000&nbsp;because they\u2019re delinquent. For many years they\u2019re delinquent. They haven\u2019t been paying what they\u2019re supposed to be paying. They\u2019re paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\u201d and they say, \u201cYes, we think by</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \u201cNo, Angela, please. Don\u2019t say that Angela. It\u2019s true. You know who I\u2019m talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \u201cAngela, that\u2019s a long time,\u201d this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \u201cNo Angela, that\u2019s not working.\u201d But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \u201cWell, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\u201d Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn\u2019t paid. I said, \u201cWhat about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\u201d So we\u2019re negotiating let\u2019s see, but in the meantime, we\u2019re reducing our troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember this, we\u2019re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we\u2019re supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We\u2019re supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don\u2019t get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We\u2019re ripped off by so many countries and we\u2019re stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don\u2019t want me here. They don\u2019t want me. There are a lot of people that don\u2019t want me. They don\u2019t sell a lot of bombs when we\u2019re not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It\u2019s called the military industrial complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When rioting and looting broke out in our nation\u2019s Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \u201cGet them in.\u201d After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We\u2019re not happy. That\u2019s going to be very expensive for DC. They\u2019re always looking for money. \u201cWe need more money. We always need more money.\u201d And then they don\u2019t do the proper job. So it\u2019s not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don\u2019t worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 2020 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn\u2019t like what he said a week ago. I said, \u201cWhere did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody\u2019s even asking?\u201d We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn\u2019t like that. A lot of people that you wouldn\u2019t even think would care that much. I\u2019ve had people that I said, \u201cThese are super left liberals and they didn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we\u2019re doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody\u2019s coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you\u2019ve ever seen or ever heard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they\u2019re not looking to do you much help. ICE, they\u2019re rough guys. they\u2019re great Americans, but they\u2019ll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They\u2019ll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn\u2019t say this, it\u2019s not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody\u2019s swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They\u2019re great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when I called them animals, I said, \u201cThey\u2019re animals.\u201d And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it\u2019s more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \u201cThese are animals.\u201d And Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cThese are human beings. They\u2019re not animals.\u201d If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden\u2019s America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that\u2019s true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you\u2019re seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don\u2019t keep them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden\u2019s record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what\u2019s great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He\u2019s been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden\u2019s supported every globalist attack on the American worker let\u2019s make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \u201cWe have to make this deal with South Korea. It\u2019s going to mean 250,000 jobs.\u201d And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn\u2019t know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn\u2019t say it. And they didn\u2019t cover it. They didn\u2019t cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that\u2019s closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That\u2019s early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He\u2019ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That\u2019s been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world\u2019s top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn\u2019t like it. You know why he didn\u2019t like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn\u2019t work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it\u2019s a little bit\u2026</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they\u2019re paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they\u2019re okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That\u2019s incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that\u2019s why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ve already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And almost more incredible, he gave him 1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they\u2019re not doing so well, are they? They\u2019re not doing so well. Someday, we\u2019re going to get credit for this, someday, but they are waiting. Iran wants to make a deal so badly. But they\u2019re told by Kerry and all these other, they shouldn\u2019t the Logan Act, but they\u2019re told Kerry and all these people, \u201cWait, because if Trump loses, you\u2019ll own America, you\u2019re going to own it.\u201d They\u2019ll say you own it. So I don\u2019t mind. I told them we can wait, but when I win, you\u2019re going to pay a much higher price than if you made a deal now, it\u2019s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son\u2019s paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full-scale assault on American life. You know that. They\u2019ll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that\u2019s perfect and they\u2019re not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don\u2019t want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you\u2019re sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O\u2019Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won\u2019t have to think back about it too much, because it won\u2019t matter. Hopefully it won\u2019t matter. No, Beto O\u2019Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that\u2019s not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it\u2019s never been before. And that\u2019s after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn\u2019t have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it\u2019s a, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an equal court, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a minority court, right? It\u2019s almost like we\u2019re a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We\u2019ll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you\u2019re the elite. They\u2019re not the elite. You\u2019re the elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somebody two days ago said, \u201cSir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, why do you call them the elite,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy?\u201d \u201cWell, they\u2019re not elite.\u201d I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we\u2019ll do it one more time. We won\u2019t even toy with them about three or four more times. We won\u2019t. We\u2019ll do it one more time. We\u2019ll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I\u2019ll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I\u2019ll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I\u2019ll only pick from that list. Biden can\u2019t release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn\u2019t be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don\u2019t understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \u201cYou won, but you have to come back and redo it.\u201d It\u2019s almost like, \u201cGee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\u201d But we\u2019re going to be refiling, but don\u2019t let it get you. Everything\u2019s going to work out really good. Everything\u2019s going to work out good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to win DACA. You\u2019re going to win DACA. That\u2019s easy. You got to win DACA. That\u2019s easy.\u201d They all said it. And they came back and they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like what you did with your paperwork,\u201d essentially. So we\u2019re re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn\u2019t lose. We\u2019re going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren\u2019t so young anymore, by the way. But we\u2019re going to work it out for everybody.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn\u2019t even know where the hell he is. Let\u2019s face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work out too well, but she\u2019s actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn\u2019t even want to win. She doesn\u2019t want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she\u2019s got no sense, no credentials. She\u2019s got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn\u2019t have a clue. You know it. But she\u2019s in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let\u2019s cancel those brand new Air Force Ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate-filled, America-bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don\u2019t think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she\u2019s telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we\u2019re going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they\u2019ve had it. They\u2019ve had it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man\u2019s personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he\u2019s never met. And he frankly probably doesn\u2019t want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else\u2019s jobs too by the way. If I didn\u2019t come along, we\u2019re building auto plants, we\u2019re building everything. And there\u2019s never been a comeback like we\u2019re making right now. Never been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn\u2019t wanted to\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don\u2019t-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they don\u2019t want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They\u2019re not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They\u2019ve done a terrible job and they shouldn\u2019t be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn\u2019t happen. It\u2019ll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We\u2019ve all worked too hard. They don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I\u2019ve done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Racial justice begins with Joe Biden\u2019s retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They\u2019re respected by everybody. They do some job, and I\u2019d have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He\u2019s running on November 3rd. I don\u2019t even know. Does he\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\u2026 There\u2019s no competition that he\u2019s got. I know he\u2019s got James\u2019 support. He\u2019s got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I\u2019d give it to James too, but he\u2019s not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also here is a man who\u2019s respected by so many. He\u2019s a little bit right of the people we\u2019ve been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you, Tom. Great job you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re glad to be joined as well by a man that I\u2019ve gotten to know. He\u2019s done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He\u2019s been here for a little while. He\u2019s done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don\u2019t want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I\u2019ll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they\u2019ve done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who\u2019s got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They\u2019re great\u2026 They are, they\u2019re warriors. I\u2019ll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we\u2019ll send Jim Inhofe back, and we\u2019ll send all of them. You\u2019ll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they\u2019ve been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I\u2019m right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody\u2019s ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re doing it again. And it\u2019s going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don\u2019t quite get it. We\u2019re doing record business. It\u2019s happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn\u2019t stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re going up. We\u2019re going up. We\u2019re going up. We\u2019re going to go up. Then we\u2019re going to hit October. We\u2019re going to be up. We\u2019re going to be way up. We\u2019re not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we\u2019re going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \u201cMan, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t believe the fake news anymore.\u201d And you\u2019re not going to want to lose your 401k\u2019s. And you\u2019re not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you\u2019ve accumulated, whether it\u2019s real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it\u2019ll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I\u2019m not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we\u2019re going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we\u2019ve ever had, okay?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don\u2019t have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don\u2019t have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \u201cWait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don\u2019t think I want to take a chance.\u201d You\u2019re not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50-day period, it\u2019s the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \u201cDarling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\u201d And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \u201cDarling, I love you so much. You\u2019ve always been a loser. You\u2019ve always lost money. But now under President Trump, you\u2019re one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\u201d And all you did was keep your stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you think you\u2019re going to run against\u2026 Oh, they\u2019re going crazy. They want the stock market to go down. Even if it costs them money, they want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money, and they don\u2019t even know why. You know what, they\u2019re smart and they\u2019re vicious, but they don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m telling you, they don\u2019t know why. What\u2019s wrong with having the strongest military brand new in the world [inaudible]? What\u2019s wrong with having these great economic numbers? What\u2019s wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let\u2019s go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He\u2019s a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it\u2019s time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they\u2019ve never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I\u2019m also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we\u2019re going to do that. It\u2019ll be done very quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice, pro choice for schools. It\u2019s very popular, but some people it\u2019s like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it\u2019s wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It\u2019s a civil right. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that\u2019s over 30%. They\u2019re controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats\u2019 push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you\u2019d never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they\u2019d see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we\u2019ll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful, 212 miles. That\u2019s a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there\u2019s something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \u201cJust leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\u201d I said, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It\u2019s so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That\u2019s happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn\u2019t President, would have never come. We will become the world\u2019s premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That\u2019s already started. We\u2019re bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America\u2019s terrorist enemies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \u201cSir, we\u2019ve just taken 100%.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it\u2019s damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn\u2019t sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we\u2019ll protect your second amendment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \u201cIn God we trust.\u201d We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Trump_Campaign_Rally_Tulsa_Oklahoma.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Donald J.
