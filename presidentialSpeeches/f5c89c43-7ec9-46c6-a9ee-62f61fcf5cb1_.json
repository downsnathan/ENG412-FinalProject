You folks have done well. I just looked at some numbers. You\u2019ve even done better than you thought, I think\u2014(laughter)\u2014based on what we just saw about 10 minutes ago.\n\r\n\r\n And I want to thank you, to the Governor of this incredible state, my very good friend, Jim Justice and his wonderful wife, Cathy, who are with us. And Jim is now a proud member of the Republican Party. He was a Democrat. He switched over, right? (Applause.) You don\u2019t see that too often. Maybe we\u2019ll see it more and more. But thank you, Jim. And the hotel is beautiful, and everything is beautiful. We appreciate it.\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s great to be among so many friends for the second time this week. Tuesday was an incredible evening, as we were all inspired. (Applause.) And I really mean that. We were inspired by America\u2019s heroes and uplifted by everyone who has sacrificed in the fight for freedom. They were, and are, incredible people that we saw that night, and tremendous courage. And one of the people, I have to say\u2014boy, you got a very big hand, Steve. Steve Scalise. A great hand. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019re all truly blessed to be Americans.\n\r\n\r\n Before going any further, I want to send our prayers to everyone affected by the train accident yesterday, and especially to the family of the person who was so tragically killed. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. And thank you.\n\r\n\r\n With us today on stage is our incredible leadership team. And they really have\u2014if you look\u2014you just look at what\u2019s happened in the last short period of time. Without them, I could have never won the Presidency, I guess. I don\u2019t know, could I have won the Presidency without them? (Laughter.) Huh? Steve, yes, right? (Laughter.) I don\u2019t know.\n\r\n\r\n But they\u2019ve become very good friends, and we\u2019re now in battle together and in friendship together. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Applause.) Thank you, Mitch. Great guy. (Applause.) That was a big win we had, Mitch. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. John, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Again, Steve, thank you. (Applause.) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. (Applause.) Chair John Thune and House Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n Did they forget your name, John? I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s going on here? (Laughter.) John Cornyn, everybody knows. They didn\u2019t put his name up, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s ever happened. Hey, John, that will never happen again. (Laughter.)\n\r\n\r\n Working together, we\u2019ve accomplished extraordinary things for the American people over the last year, and I really believe this is just the beginning. You know, Paul Ryan called me the other day, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to say this, but I will say that he said to me, he has never, ever seen the Republican Party so united, so much in like with each other. But, literally, the word \u201cunited\u201d was the word he used. It\u2019s the most united he\u2019s ever seen the party, and I see it too. I have so many friends in this group, and there is a great coming together that I don\u2019t think either party has seen for many, many years. So\u2014right?\n\r\n\r\n SPEAKER RYAN: Yep.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s good. (Applause.) I was hoping he wouldn\u2019t deny that. (Laughter.) But he did\u2014he called me, and I thought it was very nice. So thank you, Paul, very much.\n\r\n\r\n Every day, we\u2019re removing government burdens and empowering our citizens to follow their hearts and live out their dreams. The priorities of Republicans in Congress are the priorities of the American people. We believe in strong families, and we believe in strong borders. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n We believe in the rule of law, and we support the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n We believe every American has the right to grow up in a safe home and attend a good school and to have access to a really great job.\n\r\n\r\n And we know that, for Americans, nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014is out of reach because we don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u201cquit.\u201d We don\u2019t quit. And the Republican Party certainly hasn\u2019t quit\u2014because if we did, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. We\u2019d be sitting home saying, \u201cBoy, that was a tough year,\u201d instead of, \u201cThat was one of the greatest years in the history of politics, in the history of our country for a party\u2014what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done, and certainly not by much. We had a year that was almost, I would think, unlike any.\n\r\n\r\n It was a tremendous success, and I give everybody in this room the credit. And I give, certainly, these people behind me tremendous credit for what took place, especially in that last month. That was a month of tremendous pressure, and that was people that were able to act under pressure. My favorite type of person. They were able to act under tremendous pressure.\n\r\n\r\n So I just want to thank you all, because that\u2019s what it was all about. And, you know, it was interesting\u2014while we had a great year, we weren\u2019t being given credit for it\u2014regulations at a level that nobody has ever done. In one year, we knocked out more regulations than anybody. Supreme Court justice, judges, all over. So many different records. So many successes.\n\r\n\r\n But when we got the great tax cut bill\u2014and we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill\u2014we got that, it was like putting it all in a box and wrapping it with a beautiful ribbon. We started getting credit not only for that, but for all of the other things that we did during the year. It\u2019s amazing the way that happened. I was surprised, actually.\n\r\n\r\n But we got a lot of credit from a lot of people. And all of a sudden, they\u2019re saying, \u201cWhile we had a lot of accomplishment\u201d\u2014and then they went on to do the thing. But the fact is\u2014(laughter)\u2014you understand that. But we really did. We got a lot of credit. It all came together in that final month. And so I give everybody in this room, really, kudos.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re a nation of builders and dreamers and strivers and fighters. And together, we\u2019re building a safe, strong, and very proud America, already, since the election. We\u2019ve created 2.4 million jobs. That\u2019s unthinkable. (Applause.) And that doesn\u2019t include all of the things that are happening. You\u2019re going to see numbers that get even better.\n\r\n\r\n The stock market has added more than $8 trillion in new wealth. Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, which is something. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. African American and Hispanic unemployment have both reached the lowest levels ever recorded. That\u2019s something very, very special. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And when I made that statement the other night, there was zero movement from the Democrats. They sat there, stone cold, no smile, no applause. You would have thought that, on that one, they would have, sort of, at least clapped a little bit. Which tells you, perhaps, they\u2019d rather see us not do well than see our country do great. And that\u2019s not good. That\u2019s not good. We have to change that. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And as I said, we\u2019ve eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration has ever eliminated. And that means four years, eight years, or, in one instance, sixteen years. In one year, we\u2019ve knocked out more regulations. It\u2019s an amazing thing. And I happen to think that that is every bit as important toward our success as the tax cuts.\n\r\n\r\n I have many business friends and many people in business that came to me and they say that\u2014including small businesses\u2014they say the fact that they no longer have to go through years of turmoil in getting approved and getting approvals, and getting rule changes and getting all sorts of things, and getting old while they\u2019re waiting to get them\u2014the fact that all of that is gone is probably as important or even more important to the massive tax cuts we\u2019ve gotten people. So that\u2019s something.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. And I have to say, included in there is the individual mandate. We repealed it. That\u2019s a big one. (Applause.) That\u2019s so big. By itself, that would be a big achievement. And we, sort of, take it as, well, that was included.\n\r\n\r\n And ANWR, one of the great potential fields anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And I never appreciated ANWR so much. A friend of mine called up, who\u2019s in that world and in that business, and said, \u201cIs it true that you\u2019re thinking about ANWR?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I think we\u2019re going to get it, but you know.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you kidding? That\u2019s the biggest thing, by itself.\u201d He said, \u201cRonald Reagan and every President has wanted to get ANWR approved.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n And after that, I said, \u201cOh, make sure that\u2019s in the bill.\u201d (Laughter.) It was amazing how that had an impact. That had a very big impact on me, Paul. I really didn\u2019t care about it, and then when I heard that everybody wanted it\u2014for 40 years, they\u2019ve been trying to get it approved, and I said, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t lose ANWR.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\r\n\r\n But it\u2019s great for the people of Alaska. And Senator Sullivan and Senator Murkowski are here someplace. Where are they? But they are very happy campers. Senator? (Applause.) Good, Senator. Thank you. They worked very\u2014\n\r\n\r\n LEADER RYAN: And Don Young.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Where\u2019s Don Young? He\u2019s such a quiet guy. Where Is Don? (Laughter.) Don Young, also. Don, thank you.\n\r\n\r\n AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) all along.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: So\u2014no, we were always going to get it. We never had a problem with it. But if you think about, that by itself is a big bill. The individual mandate by itself is a big, powerful bill. That was just added on to what we did with the massive tax cuts.\n\r\n\r\n I want to thank Senate Finance Chairman\u2014and a very spectacular man\u2014Orrin Hatch. (Applause.) Where\u2019s Orrin? Orrin. Orrin is\u2014I love listening to him speak. He said once, I am the single greatest President in his lifetime. Now, he\u2019s a young man, so it\u2019s not that much, but\u2014(laughter). And he actually once said I\u2019m the greatest President in the history of our country. And I said, \u201cDoes that include Lincoln and Washington?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cI love this guy.\u201d (Laughter.) I love him. But he is, he\u2019s a special guy.\n\r\n\r\n And House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady for their incredible work. (Applause.) Kevin? Where are you, Kevin? That\u2019s\u2014what a job. I\u2019d call Kevin night after night. \u201cKevin, what about this? What about that?\u201d You were always there. He was working. What did you average sleep for about four weeks? About\u2014maybe nothing? I think he had no average. But you did a great job. Nobody knows it better than you, Kevin. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n Maybe we\u2019ll do a phase two, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll do a phase two. Are you ready for that, Kevin? Huh? I think you\u2019re ready. (Laughter.) We\u2019ll get them even lower. But we are proud of you.\n\r\n\r\n Here in West Virginia, as a result of our tax cuts, the typical family of four will save roughly $2,000 a year. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. And when I came into this beautiful building just a little while ago, one of the people said, \u201cYou know, I just got a check, and I have $221 more than I had last year at this time in my envelope.\u201d (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And that one\u2014really, that\u2019s what we were waiting. We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody that Nancy Pelosi called \u201ccrumbs.\u201d That was a bad\u2014that could be like \u201cdeplorable.\u201d Does that make sense? \u201cDeplorable\u201d and \u201ccrumbs\u201d\u2014those two words, they seem to have a resemblance. I hope it has the same meaning. But she called it crumbs, when people are getting $2,000 and $3,000 and $1,000. That\u2019s not crumbs. That\u2019s a lot of money.\n\r\n\r\n We also doubled the child tax credit, and that\u2019s so helpful to so many. We\u2019ve gone from one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, to one of the most competitive\u2014one of the lower ones\u2014so that our great workers and companies can compete and win against anyone.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve now given them the tools to go out and win. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. And they\u2019re also pouring back. A lot of you folks, you saw Davos the other day, they\u2019re coming back. I believe I brought hundreds of billions of dollars with me back from Europe, back from Switzerland, when I went there the other day to make a speech. They\u2019re so excited about this country and what\u2019s happening here. And they would never, ever have come.\n\r\n\r\n In fact, if the opposing party had won the election, you would have had tremendous new rules and regulations put on everything, and other things would have happened. And instead of going up almost 50 percent, your stock market, in my opinion, would have gone down 50 percent\u2014I really believe that\u2014because they were stifling it. They were getting prepared to stifle even worse than it was.\n\r\n\r\n The changes to our business tax alone are expected to raise average household income by $4,000. Roughly 3 million workers have already received tax cut bonuses and raises totaling thousands and thousands of dollars per worker\u2014and that\u2019s just over the past six weeks alone.\n\r\n\r\n Because of our tax cuts, Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States. They\u2019re bringing $240 billion back\u2014$240 billion. They\u2019re going to pay a tax of $38 billion, Mitch\u2014$38 billion. But they\u2019re going to invest a total of $350 billion. And when I first heard the number, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean billion, you mean $350 million.\u201d Because I\u2019ve been saying to Tim Cook, \u201cTim, we got to build plants here.\u201d You know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants. And this would have never happened without us and the work you\u2019ve done. And they\u2019re hiring 20,000 workers, by the way. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And two days ago, ExxonMobil, in addition to many others, just announced that they are investing $50 billion in the United States. So the good news just keeps on rolling in, and it\u2019s going to.\n\r\n\r\n And I want to thank Senator Tim Scott for \u201copportunity zones.\u201d Our tax plan encourages this investment. Where is Tim? What a good guy Tim is. (Applause.) Tim. See him over there someplace? Thank you, Tim. But we\u2019re investing in distressed communities to create more jobs for those who have too often been left behind. And Tim worked hard on that.\n\r\n\r\n We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck, and the satisfaction of a job really well done. And we\u2019re reaching our hand all across the aisle in pursuit of common ground and commonsense reforms for the good of all Americans. All Americans.\n\r\n\r\n We can reform our prison system to help those who have served their time get a second chance at life. And I\u2019ve watched this, and I\u2019ve seen it, and I\u2019ve studied it. And people get out of prison, and they made a mistake. And not all\u2014some are very bad, but many are very good. And they come home and they can\u2019t get a job. It\u2019s sad. They can\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s\u2014they can\u2019t get a job.\n\r\n\r\n Now, the best thing we\u2019ve done to fix that, Paul, is the fact that the economy is just booming. I mean, that fixes it better than any program we can do, anything we can do at all. But the economy is so strong now and so good, and so many companies are moving in that I really believe that problem\u2014it\u2019s a big problem\u2014is going to solve itself. But we\u2019re working on it.\n\r\n\r\n We can invest in workforce development, job training, and open new vocational schools, because we want every American to be able to reach their full God-given potential. Vocational schools\u2014today you have community colleges and you have all of the\u2014when I was growing up, we had vocational schools.\n\r\n\r\n And when I was going to school, I remember I was in high school, and there were people in class\u2014one person in particular, he wasn\u2019t, like, the greatest student. And\u2014he just wasn\u2019t. And yet, I saw him one day, and he was able to fix a car engine, blindfolded. And everybody else was saying that\u2019s amazing how talented he is. He had a different kind of a talent. And we should have vocational schools. You learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry, and all of these things. We don\u2019t have that very much anymore.\n\r\n\r\n And I think the word \u201cvocational\u201d is a much better word than, in many cases, a community college. A lot of people don\u2019t know what a community college means or represents. So we\u2019re working very hard on vocational schools so that when all these companies move into this country, we\u2019re going to have a workforce that knows exactly what they\u2019re doing.\n\r\n\r\n In addition to that, when they move in, we\u2019re giving them incentives to also train people themselves. Because, in many ways, that\u2019s the best way to do it. In Wisconsin, we have a great company moving in. They make all of the Apple iPhones, and they\u2019re going to have a big program. They\u2019re going to have a tremendous program to teach people how to do this, because it\u2019s a whole new skill. And it will be very successful.\n\r\n\r\n We can reduce the price of prescription drugs and ensure that terminally ill patients have a right to try. (Applause.) So important\u2014right to try. You know, those drugs, they sit in there for 12, 13, 14 years. And a person is terminally ill, they have two months left, and under the old system they don\u2019t want to give them even an experimental medicine because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be hurt. Well, they\u2019re not going to be around for two months.\n\r\n\r\n So they\u2019ll sign a waiver, and we\u2019re going to give them the hope of finding something. You have people\u2014and I\u2019ve known people like this\u2014they travel all over the world to try and find a cure. And we have great experimental drugs, but it will be years before they come on to the market.\n\r\n\r\n So it\u2019s called Right to Try, and I hope you folks can approve it, and I hope you agree with it. But I think it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s so important. (Applause.) And Scott Gottlieb is heading it up. And it\u2019s\u2014and the other thing you get is you learn pretty quickly how effective it is; does it work. But you learn it really, very quickly. So, Right to Try.\n\r\n\r\n We can fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones that are fair. And the most important word to me, on trade, is \u201creciprocal.\u201d Because we have deals where companies will send in a motorbike, and we charge them nothing. But when we send a Harley-Davidson or a motorbike to those countries, they charge us 100 percent tax. That\u2019s not fair. So they\u2019ll send their motorbikes, or something, into us\u2014zero. We send it to them\u2014100 percent. That\u2019s not fair trade. That\u2019s not fair.\n\r\n\r\n So I like the word \u201creciprocal.\u201d If they\u2019re going to do it to us, we\u2019re going to do it to them. And what\u2019s going to happen is your numbers are going to either come down, or we\u2019re going to make a lot of money. And either one is okay, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\r\n\r\n We can rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and we will; streamline the horrible approval process\u2014roadways that take 12, 13, 14 years to get approved. We used to build them in three months, and now it takes years and years of approvals. We\u2019re going to bring that down, ideally, to one year. Two years is our goal, but one year is our real goal. And we can get it done under budget, and we want to get it done ahead of schedule. Because you don\u2019t have too many of them. Under budget and ahead of schedule.\n\r\n\r\n We can deliver for our police, our veterans, and our brave servicemembers. And finally, after decades of waiting, we can finally pass immigration reform that protects our country, defends our borders, and modernizes our immigration rules to serve the needs of American workers and of American families. So important.\n\r\n\r\n One of the strengths of the Republican Party is that we\u2019re a big tent with many diverse views, but the one thing we can all agree on\u2014and that\u2019s that, in every decision, we make our highest priority to serve and to protect the American people.\n\r\n\r\n We want an immigration policy that\u2019s fair, equitable, but that\u2019s going to protect our people. We want people coming into our country based on merit and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, and they respect our people and our country. We don\u2019t want visa lottery. Pick a lottery ticket. Pick a lottery. We don\u2019t want that. So we want it based on merit. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n We have a chance now to pass into law the immigration reforms that the American people have been demanding for decades and that many of you have been working on for your entire careers. We have a great opportunity as a Republican Party. As the Republican Party, we have a great opportunity. We\u2019re getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope after I leave this room, we\u2019re going to get a call from these people saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n You know, they talk a good game. We have to get help from the other side, or we have to elect many more Republicans. That\u2019s another way of doing it. (Applause.) Really, that\u2019s another way of doing it. And based on the numbers we just saw, we have a real chance of doing that. You know, \u201918 is going to be very interesting. But we\u2019ve got to do one or the other. Either they\u2019re going to have to come on board\u2014because they talk a good game with DACA, but they don\u2019t produce.\n\r\n\r\n And so either they come on board, or we\u2019re just going to have to really work and we\u2019re going to have to get more people so we can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass, in a much easier fashion, legislation. And to get it done, we\u2019ll all have to make some compromises along the way\u2014to get it done this way. Now, to get it done the other way, if we win more, we don\u2019t have to compromise so much. Okay? With the tax bill, we got what we wanted because we had, essentially, a unanimous vote.\n\r\n\r\n But we have to go, and we have to get it done and get it done properly, and we\u2019re going to have to compromise\u2014unless we elect more Republicans, in which case, we can have it just the way everybody in this room wants it. We have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot.\n\r\n\r\n If we\u2019re united, if we work together for the good of the nation, and we can fulfill our sacred duty to the country and to our incredible voters, we have really fulfilled a solemn promise.\n\r\n\r\n As you know, I have put forward an immigration framework based on many months of meeting and working with Tom Cotton, and working with John Cornyn, who was in the office the other day, and David Perdue\u2014incredible people\u2014and Bob Goodlatte, who\u2019s out here someplace. Really incredible people. And it\u2019s a strong bill, but it\u2019s a very fair bill. And it protects our border. We have to protect our borders. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n It includes reforms that are overwhelmingly popular with the voters, including Democrats. The Democrats want to have\u2014the real Democrats, they want to have their borders protected. But it includes Democrats, independents, Republicans. Americans want an immigration system that works for everybody. And they want safety.\n\r\n\r\n And, by the way, they also want a strong military. And we have to be very powerful on our military. You know, our military has been depleted over the last long period of time, even beyond Obama. It\u2019s been depleted. We\u2019ve got to build up. This should not be a party thing; this should be common sense. Without our military, we might not be here talking. We have to have a strong military.\n\r\n\r\n And I think we\u2019re very much on our way. From the one standpoint, we\u2019re going for funding, which we need, and I think we\u2019ll get it. But we have a lot of fighting on that from the other side, and we can\u2019t even think about it. We need a strong and powerful military. And we\u2019re going to have far more powerful than we were ever before. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n Nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on DACA. And I\u2019ve been hearing about DACA for so many years. Some people call it DREAMers. It\u2019s not DREAMers. Don\u2019t fall into that trap. It\u2019s just much different than DREAMers. And I said the other night, you know, we have dreamers too. We have dreamers in this country, too. You can\u2019t forget our dreamers. I have a lot of dreamers here. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n But DACA\u2014we want to take care of DACA, and I hope we will. We need the support of the Democrats in order to do it, and they might not want to do it. They talk like they do, but I don\u2019t think they do. But we\u2019re going to find out very soon.\n\r\n\r\n We want something that is very, very tough and strong, in terms of the border. We need to end chain migration, and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And those are the four pillars that I talked about the other night. We call them the White House framework\u2014a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st Century.\n\r\n\r\n The Republican position on immigration is the center, mainstream view of the American people, with some extra strength at the border and security at the border added in. What we\u2019re asking for and what the American people are pleading for is sanity and common sense in our immigration system. We want immigration rules that protect our communities, defend our security, and admit people who will love our country and contribute to our society.\n\r\n\r\n I know that the Senate is planning to bring an immigration bill on the floor, to the floor, in coming weeks. And I\u2019m asking that the framework we submitted\u2014with great flexibility, great flexibility, working with both parties\u2014that something very positive will come out of it for our country, for everybody\u2014for our country. And I think that can happen.\n\r\n\r\n If the Democrats choose to filibuster a framework that includes a generous path to citizenship or something that is not fair, we are not going to approve it. We\u2019re just not going to approve it.\n\r\n\r\n So we\u2019ll either have something that\u2019s fair and equitable and good and secure, or we\u2019re going to have nothing at all. And this has been going on for many years. It doesn\u2019t make sense, however, to have nothing at all, because this is something that people want.\n\r\n\r\n So we will be demonstrating that we are very, very serious. One of the reasons I gave a number that was, I thought, a very generous number was because I wanted to see whether or not they were interested in approving that. Because if they don\u2019t approve something within that sphere, that means, very simply, that they\u2019re not looking to approve it at all. They want to use it for an election issue, but it\u2019s now an election issue that will go to our benefit, not their benefit. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n But make no mistake: I will not rest until we have delivered for the citizens of our great country so many different things\u2014immigration, the strong military. We\u2019ve done an awfully good job of protecting our Second Amendment. That was in question during the campaign, you remember, and we have done a very, very good job. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n For the last 12 months, I have kept one promise after another, and we\u2019re just getting started. So often I\u2019ll see\u2014and I must say, six, seven months ago, they were saying, he didn\u2019t fulfill his promise on this or that. I said, I\u2019ve only been here for four months. You know, other people were there for eight years and they would finally get something passed. I was there four months\u2014you know this, Paul\u2014and they were saying, \u201cHe didn\u2019t fulfill a promise.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n But now we\u2019ve fulfilled far more promises than we promised. (Laughter.) And they\u2019re having a hard time with that. We have seriously fulfilled promises. I call it \u201cpromises plus.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\r\n\r\n And one of the things we\u2019re doing that\u2019s so important\u2014and Mitch has worked so hard on, and Don, and everybody\u2014is the justices, the judges all over the country. We\u2019re filling up the courts with really talented people who understand and read the Constitution for what it says. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n So it\u2019s really not talked about that much, but it is a tremendous impact. It\u2019s having already a tremendous impact. And we have incredible people lined up\u2014just lined up\u2014that are getting ready to go into the courts. And, in many ways, Mitch, I think it\u2019s going to be one of the most important things, if not the most important thing, that we\u2019re doing.\n\r\n\r\n Defense is always the most. Got to be the most, John, right? But what we\u2019re doing with the courts, I think, is going to go down as one of the greatest achievements, so I want to thank you for that. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n And not only are we protecting America at home, we\u2019re protecting our interests abroad. It\u2019s time to finally end the dangerous defense sequester. It would be wonderful if we could go back to a budget\u2014(applause)\u2014in order to fully fund our military, and do it properly and order properly, and have it over a period of time, and do it the right way. So at some point, I hope, we\u2019re going to be able to do that and it should work.\n\r\n\r\n And in order to defeat terrorists, we\u2019re also asking Congress to ensure that we continue to have all necessary power and everything we need to defeat and detain the terrorists. We can\u2019t treat terrorists like common criminals; they are really unlawful enemy combatants. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n When you see what they do and the way they do it, and the level of ferocity, we can\u2019t treat them the way we do the ordinary criminal. And as you saw on Tuesday, I\u2019ve signed an order keeping open our very secure detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.) It\u2019s another promise kept.\n\r\n\r\n And there is one more very important promise we\u2019re keeping: No longer are we making apologies for America. We don\u2019t apologize anymore. (Applause.) We\u2019re proud of our history, we\u2019re confident in our values, and we\u2019re grateful to our heroes, and we are determined to create a brighter future for all of our people. We are restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us all, as friends, as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans. Because when Americans are united, nothing\u2014nothing at all\u2014nothing can stop us. We win. (Applause.)\n\r\n\r\n As I said the other night, we are a nation that built the Empire State Building in one year. Actually, to be exact, it was\u2014we built it in less than a year. Would you believe it? Working 24 hours around the clock.\n\r\n\r\n We built the Hoover Dam in record time. We built the Golden Gate Bridge. We linked our nation together with railroads and highways. We dug out the Panama Canal. We\u2019re the nation that won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put satellites into space and planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. We\u2019ve healed the sick, cured disease, and cared for the poor like no other nation. We\u2019ve lifted millions into prosperity, and delivered millions into freedom.\n\r\n\r\n This is our legacy. This is our birthright. And this is the foundation on which we build our very glorious future. Because together, we are, indeed, making America great again.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Paul and Mitch, for the introduction and for your tremendous leadership. You folks have done well. I just looked at some numbers. You\u2019ve even done better than you thought, I think\u2014(laughter)\u2014based on what we just saw about 10 minutes ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I want to thank you, to the Governor of this incredible state, my very good friend, Jim Justice and his wonderful wife, Cathy, who are with us. And Jim is now a proud member of the Republican Party. He was a Democrat. He switched over, right? (Applause.) You don\u2019t see that too often. Maybe we\u2019ll see it more and more. But thank you, Jim. And the hotel is beautiful, and everything is beautiful. We appreciate it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s great to be among so many friends for the second time this week. Tuesday was an incredible evening, as we were all inspired. (Applause.) And I really mean that. We were inspired by America\u2019s heroes and uplifted by everyone who has sacrificed in the fight for freedom. They were, and are, incredible people that we saw that night, and tremendous courage. And one of the people, I have to say\u2014boy, you got a very big hand, Steve. Steve Scalise. A great hand. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019re all truly blessed to be Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before going any further, I want to send our prayers to everyone affected by the train accident yesterday, and especially to the family of the person who was so tragically killed. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. And thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With us today on stage is our incredible leadership team. And they really have\u2014if you look\u2014you just look at what\u2019s happened in the last short period of time. Without them, I could have never won the Presidency, I guess. I don\u2019t know, could I have won the Presidency without them? (Laughter.) Huh? Steve, yes, right? (Laughter.) I don\u2019t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they\u2019ve become very good friends, and we\u2019re now in battle together and in friendship together. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Applause.) Thank you, Mitch. Great guy. (Applause.) That was a big win we had, Mitch. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. John, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Again, Steve, thank you. (Applause.) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. (Applause.) Chair John Thune and House Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did they forget your name, John? I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s going on here? (Laughter.) John Cornyn, everybody knows. They didn\u2019t put his name up, but that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s ever happened. Hey, John, that will never happen again. (Laughter.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working together, we\u2019ve accomplished extraordinary things for the American people over the last year, and I really believe this is just the beginning. You know, Paul Ryan called me the other day, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to say this, but I will say that he said to me, he has never, ever seen the Republican Party so united, so much in like with each other. But, literally, the word \u201cunited\u201d was the word he used. It\u2019s the most united he\u2019s ever seen the party, and I see it too. I have so many friends in this group, and there is a great coming together that I don\u2019t think either party has seen for many, many years. So\u2014right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPEAKER RYAN: Yep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s good. (Applause.) I was hoping he wouldn\u2019t deny that. (Laughter.) But he did\u2014he called me, and I thought it was very nice. So thank you, Paul, very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day, we\u2019re removing government burdens and empowering our citizens to follow their hearts and live out their dreams. The priorities of Republicans in Congress are the priorities of the American people. We believe in strong families, and we believe in strong borders. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe in the rule of law, and we support the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe every American has the right to grow up in a safe home and attend a good school and to have access to a really great job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we know that, for Americans, nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014is out of reach because we don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u201cquit.\u201d We don\u2019t quit. And the Republican Party certainly hasn\u2019t quit\u2014because if we did, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. We\u2019d be sitting home saying, \u201cBoy, that was a tough year,\u201d instead of, \u201cThat was one of the greatest years in the history of politics, in the history of our country for a party\u2014what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been done, and certainly not by much. We had a year that was almost, I would think, unlike any.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a tremendous success, and I give everybody in this room the credit. And I give, certainly, these people behind me tremendous credit for what took place, especially in that last month. That was a month of tremendous pressure, and that was people that were able to act under pressure. My favorite type of person. They were able to act under tremendous pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I just want to thank you all, because that\u2019s what it was all about. And, you know, it was interesting\u2014while we had a great year, we weren\u2019t being given credit for it\u2014regulations at a level that nobody has ever done. In one year, we knocked out more regulations than anybody. Supreme Court justice, judges, all over. So many different records. So many successes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when we got the great tax cut bill\u2014and we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill\u2014we got that, it was like putting it all in a box and wrapping it with a beautiful ribbon. We started getting credit not only for that, but for all of the other things that we did during the year. It\u2019s amazing the way that happened. I was surprised, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we got a lot of credit from a lot of people. And all of a sudden, they\u2019re saying, \u201cWhile we had a lot of accomplishment\u201d\u2014and then they went on to do the thing. But the fact is\u2014(laughter)\u2014you understand that. But we really did. We got a lot of credit. It all came together in that final month. And so I give everybody in this room, really, kudos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re a nation of builders and dreamers and strivers and fighters. And together, we\u2019re building a safe, strong, and very proud America, already, since the election. We\u2019ve created 2.4 million jobs. That\u2019s unthinkable. (Applause.) And that doesn\u2019t include all of the things that are happening. You\u2019re going to see numbers that get even better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock market has added more than $8 trillion in new wealth. Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, which is something. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. African American and Hispanic unemployment have both reached the lowest levels ever recorded. That\u2019s something very, very special. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when I made that statement the other night, there was zero movement from the Democrats. They sat there, stone cold, no smile, no applause. You would have thought that, on that one, they would have, sort of, at least clapped a little bit. Which tells you, perhaps, they\u2019d rather see us not do well than see our country do great. And that\u2019s not good. That\u2019s not good. We have to change that. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as I said, we\u2019ve eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration has ever eliminated. And that means four years, eight years, or, in one instance, sixteen years. In one year, we\u2019ve knocked out more regulations. It\u2019s an amazing thing. And I happen to think that that is every bit as important toward our success as the tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have many business friends and many people in business that came to me and they say that\u2014including small businesses\u2014they say the fact that they no longer have to go through years of turmoil in getting approved and getting approvals, and getting rule changes and getting all sorts of things, and getting old while they\u2019re waiting to get them\u2014the fact that all of that is gone is probably as important or even more important to the massive tax cuts we\u2019ve gotten people. So that\u2019s something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. And I have to say, included in there is the individual mandate. We repealed it. That\u2019s a big one. (Applause.) That\u2019s so big. By itself, that would be a big achievement. And we, sort of, take it as, well, that was included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And ANWR, one of the great potential fields anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And I never appreciated ANWR so much. A friend of mine called up, who\u2019s in that world and in that business, and said, \u201cIs it true that you\u2019re thinking about ANWR?\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, I think we\u2019re going to get it, but you know.\u201d He said, \u201cAre you kidding? That\u2019s the biggest thing, by itself.\u201d He said, \u201cRonald Reagan and every President has wanted to get ANWR approved.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And after that, I said, \u201cOh, make sure that\u2019s in the bill.\u201d (Laughter.) It was amazing how that had an impact. That had a very big impact on me, Paul. I really didn\u2019t care about it, and then when I heard that everybody wanted it\u2014for 40 years, they\u2019ve been trying to get it approved, and I said, \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t lose ANWR.\u201d (Laughter.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it\u2019s great for the people of Alaska. And Senator Sullivan and Senator Murkowski are here someplace. Where are they? But they are very happy campers. Senator? (Applause.) Good, Senator. Thank you. They worked very\u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LEADER RYAN: And Don Young.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Where\u2019s Don Young? He\u2019s such a quiet guy. Where Is Don? (Laughter.) Don Young, also. Don, thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) all along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: So\u2014no, we were always going to get it. We never had a problem with it. But if you think about, that by itself is a big bill. The individual mandate by itself is a big, powerful bill. That was just added on to what we did with the massive tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to thank Senate Finance Chairman\u2014and a very spectacular man\u2014Orrin Hatch. (Applause.) Where\u2019s Orrin? Orrin. Orrin is\u2014I love listening to him speak. He said once, I am the single greatest President in his lifetime. Now, he\u2019s a young man, so it\u2019s not that much, but\u2014(laughter). And he actually once said I\u2019m the greatest President in the history of our country. And I said, \u201cDoes that include Lincoln and Washington?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cI love this guy.\u201d (Laughter.) I love him. But he is, he\u2019s a special guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady for their incredible work. (Applause.) Kevin? Where are you, Kevin? That\u2019s\u2014what a job. I\u2019d call Kevin night after night. \u201cKevin, what about this? What about that?\u201d You were always there. He was working. What did you average sleep for about four weeks? About\u2014maybe nothing? I think he had no average. But you did a great job. Nobody knows it better than you, Kevin. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe we\u2019ll do a phase two, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll do a phase two. Are you ready for that, Kevin? Huh? I think you\u2019re ready. (Laughter.) We\u2019ll get them even lower. But we are proud of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here in West Virginia, as a result of our tax cuts, the typical family of four will save roughly $2,000 a year. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. And when I came into this beautiful building just a little while ago, one of the people said, \u201cYou know, I just got a check, and I have $221 more than I had last year at this time in my envelope.\u201d (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that one\u2014really, that\u2019s what we were waiting. We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody that Nancy Pelosi called \u201ccrumbs.\u201d That was a bad\u2014that could be like \u201cdeplorable.\u201d Does that make sense? \u201cDeplorable\u201d and \u201ccrumbs\u201d\u2014those two words, they seem to have a resemblance. I hope it has the same meaning. But she called it crumbs, when people are getting $2,000 and $3,000 and $1,000. That\u2019s not crumbs. That\u2019s a lot of money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also doubled the child tax credit, and that\u2019s so helpful to so many. We\u2019ve gone from one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, to one of the most competitive\u2014one of the lower ones\u2014so that our great workers and companies can compete and win against anyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve now given them the tools to go out and win. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. And they\u2019re also pouring back. A lot of you folks, you saw Davos the other day, they\u2019re coming back. I believe I brought hundreds of billions of dollars with me back from Europe, back from Switzerland, when I went there the other day to make a speech. They\u2019re so excited about this country and what\u2019s happening here. And they would never, ever have come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, if the opposing party had won the election, you would have had tremendous new rules and regulations put on everything, and other things would have happened. And instead of going up almost 50 percent, your stock market, in my opinion, would have gone down 50 percent\u2014I really believe that\u2014because they were stifling it. They were getting prepared to stifle even worse than it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes to our business tax alone are expected to raise average household income by $4,000. Roughly 3 million workers have already received tax cut bonuses and raises totaling thousands and thousands of dollars per worker\u2014and that\u2019s just over the past six weeks alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of our tax cuts, Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States. They\u2019re bringing $240 billion back\u2014$240 billion. They\u2019re going to pay a tax of $38 billion, Mitch\u2014$38 billion. But they\u2019re going to invest a total of $350 billion. And when I first heard the number, I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean billion, you mean $350 million.\u201d Because I\u2019ve been saying to Tim Cook, \u201cTim, we got to build plants here.\u201d You know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\u2019re going to build a lot of plants. And this would have never happened without us and the work you\u2019ve done. And they\u2019re hiring 20,000 workers, by the way. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And two days ago, ExxonMobil, in addition to many others, just announced that they are investing $50 billion in the United States. So the good news just keeps on rolling in, and it\u2019s going to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I want to thank Senator Tim Scott for \u201copportunity zones.\u201d Our tax plan encourages this investment. Where is Tim? What a good guy Tim is. (Applause.) Tim. See him over there someplace? Thank you, Tim. But we\u2019re investing in distressed communities to create more jobs for those who have too often been left behind. And Tim worked hard on that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck, and the satisfaction of a job really well done. And we\u2019re reaching our hand all across the aisle in pursuit of common ground and commonsense reforms for the good of all Americans. All Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can reform our prison system to help those who have served their time get a second chance at life. And I\u2019ve watched this, and I\u2019ve seen it, and I\u2019ve studied it. And people get out of prison, and they made a mistake. And not all\u2014some are very bad, but many are very good. And they come home and they can\u2019t get a job. It\u2019s sad. They can\u2019t\u2014there\u2019s\u2014they can\u2019t get a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the best thing we\u2019ve done to fix that, Paul, is the fact that the economy is just booming. I mean, that fixes it better than any program we can do, anything we can do at all. But the economy is so strong now and so good, and so many companies are moving in that I really believe that problem\u2014it\u2019s a big problem\u2014is going to solve itself. But we\u2019re working on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can invest in workforce development, job training, and open new vocational schools, because we want every American to be able to reach their full God-given potential. Vocational schools\u2014today you have community colleges and you have all of the\u2014when I was growing up, we had vocational schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when I was going to school, I remember I was in high school, and there were people in class\u2014one person in particular, he wasn\u2019t, like, the greatest student. And\u2014he just wasn\u2019t. And yet, I saw him one day, and he was able to fix a car engine, blindfolded. And everybody else was saying that\u2019s amazing how talented he is. He had a different kind of a talent. And we should have vocational schools. You learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry, and all of these things. We don\u2019t have that very much anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I think the word \u201cvocational\u201d is a much better word than, in many cases, a community college. A lot of people don\u2019t know what a community college means or represents. So we\u2019re working very hard on vocational schools so that when all these companies move into this country, we\u2019re going to have a workforce that knows exactly what they\u2019re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to that, when they move in, we\u2019re giving them incentives to also train people themselves. Because, in many ways, that\u2019s the best way to do it. In Wisconsin, we have a great company moving in. They make all of the Apple iPhones, and they\u2019re going to have a big program. They\u2019re going to have a tremendous program to teach people how to do this, because it\u2019s a whole new skill. And it will be very successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can reduce the price of prescription drugs and ensure that terminally ill patients have a right to try. (Applause.) So important\u2014right to try. You know, those drugs, they sit in there for 12, 13, 14 years. And a person is terminally ill, they have two months left, and under the old system they don\u2019t want to give them even an experimental medicine because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be hurt. Well, they\u2019re not going to be around for two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So they\u2019ll sign a waiver, and we\u2019re going to give them the hope of finding something. You have people\u2014and I\u2019ve known people like this\u2014they travel all over the world to try and find a cure. And we have great experimental drugs, but it will be years before they come on to the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it\u2019s called Right to Try, and I hope you folks can approve it, and I hope you agree with it. But I think it\u2019s so important. It\u2019s so important. (Applause.) And Scott Gottlieb is heading it up. And it\u2019s\u2014and the other thing you get is you learn pretty quickly how effective it is; does it work. But you learn it really, very quickly. So, Right to Try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones that are fair. And the most important word to me, on trade, is \u201creciprocal.\u201d Because we have deals where companies will send in a motorbike, and we charge them nothing. But when we send a Harley-Davidson or a motorbike to those countries, they charge us 100 percent tax. That\u2019s not fair. So they\u2019ll send their motorbikes, or something, into us\u2014zero. We send it to them\u2014100 percent. That\u2019s not fair trade. That\u2019s not fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I like the word \u201creciprocal.\u201d If they\u2019re going to do it to us, we\u2019re going to do it to them. And what\u2019s going to happen is your numbers are going to either come down, or we\u2019re going to make a lot of money. And either one is okay, as far as I\u2019m concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and we will; streamline the horrible approval process\u2014roadways that take 12, 13, 14 years to get approved. We used to build them in three months, and now it takes years and years of approvals. We\u2019re going to bring that down, ideally, to one year. Two years is our goal, but one year is our real goal. And we can get it done under budget, and we want to get it done ahead of schedule. Because you don\u2019t have too many of them. Under budget and ahead of schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can deliver for our police, our veterans, and our brave servicemembers. And finally, after decades of waiting, we can finally pass immigration reform that protects our country, defends our borders, and modernizes our immigration rules to serve the needs of American workers and of American families. So important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the strengths of the Republican Party is that we\u2019re a big tent with many diverse views, but the one thing we can all agree on\u2014and that\u2019s that, in every decision, we make our highest priority to serve and to protect the American people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want an immigration policy that\u2019s fair, equitable, but that\u2019s going to protect our people. We want people coming into our country based on merit and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, and they respect our people and our country. We don\u2019t want visa lottery. Pick a lottery ticket. Pick a lottery. We don\u2019t want that. So we want it based on merit. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a chance now to pass into law the immigration reforms that the American people have been demanding for decades and that many of you have been working on for your entire careers. We have a great opportunity as a Republican Party. As the Republican Party, we have a great opportunity. We\u2019re getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope after I leave this room, we\u2019re going to get a call from these people saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, they talk a good game. We have to get help from the other side, or we have to elect many more Republicans. That\u2019s another way of doing it. (Applause.) Really, that\u2019s another way of doing it. And based on the numbers we just saw, we have a real chance of doing that. You know, \u201918 is going to be very interesting. But we\u2019ve got to do one or the other. Either they\u2019re going to have to come on board\u2014because they talk a good game with DACA, but they don\u2019t produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so either they come on board, or we\u2019re just going to have to really work and we\u2019re going to have to get more people so we can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass, in a much easier fashion, legislation. And to get it done, we\u2019ll all have to make some compromises along the way\u2014to get it done this way. Now, to get it done the other way, if we win more, we don\u2019t have to compromise so much. Okay? With the tax bill, we got what we wanted because we had, essentially, a unanimous vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we have to go, and we have to get it done and get it done properly, and we\u2019re going to have to compromise\u2014unless we elect more Republicans, in which case, we can have it just the way everybody in this room wants it. We have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we\u2019re united, if we work together for the good of the nation, and we can fulfill our sacred duty to the country and to our incredible voters, we have really fulfilled a solemn promise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know, I have put forward an immigration framework based on many months of meeting and working with Tom Cotton, and working with John Cornyn, who was in the office the other day, and David Perdue\u2014incredible people\u2014and Bob Goodlatte, who\u2019s out here someplace. Really incredible people. And it\u2019s a strong bill, but it\u2019s a very fair bill. And it protects our border. We have to protect our borders. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It includes reforms that are overwhelmingly popular with the voters, including Democrats. The Democrats want to have\u2014the real Democrats, they want to have their borders protected. But it includes Democrats, independents, Republicans. Americans want an immigration system that works for everybody. And they want safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, by the way, they also want a strong military. And we have to be very powerful on our military. You know, our military has been depleted over the last long period of time, even beyond Obama. It\u2019s been depleted. We\u2019ve got to build up. This should not be a party thing; this should be common sense. Without our military, we might not be here talking. We have to have a strong military.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I think we\u2019re very much on our way. From the one standpoint, we\u2019re going for funding, which we need, and I think we\u2019ll get it. But we have a lot of fighting on that from the other side, and we can\u2019t even think about it. We need a strong and powerful military. And we\u2019re going to have far more powerful than we were ever before. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on DACA. And I\u2019ve been hearing about DACA for so many years. Some people call it DREAMers. It\u2019s not DREAMers. Don\u2019t fall into that trap. It\u2019s just much different than DREAMers. And I said the other night, you know, we have dreamers too. We have dreamers in this country, too. You can\u2019t forget our dreamers. I have a lot of dreamers here. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But DACA\u2014we want to take care of DACA, and I hope we will. We need the support of the Democrats in order to do it, and they might not want to do it. They talk like they do, but I don\u2019t think they do. But we\u2019re going to find out very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want something that is very, very tough and strong, in terms of the border. We need to end chain migration, and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And those are the four pillars that I talked about the other night. We call them the White House framework\u2014a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st Century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Republican position on immigration is the center, mainstream view of the American people, with some extra strength at the border and security at the border added in. What we\u2019re asking for and what the American people are pleading for is sanity and common sense in our immigration system. We want immigration rules that protect our communities, defend our security, and admit people who will love our country and contribute to our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know that the Senate is planning to bring an immigration bill on the floor, to the floor, in coming weeks. And I\u2019m asking that the framework we submitted\u2014with great flexibility, great flexibility, working with both parties\u2014that something very positive will come out of it for our country, for everybody\u2014for our country. And I think that can happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Democrats choose to filibuster a framework that includes a generous path to citizenship or something that is not fair, we are not going to approve it. We\u2019re just not going to approve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we\u2019ll either have something that\u2019s fair and equitable and good and secure, or we\u2019re going to have nothing at all. And this has been going on for many years. It doesn\u2019t make sense, however, to have nothing at all, because this is something that people want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we will be demonstrating that we are very, very serious. One of the reasons I gave a number that was, I thought, a very generous number was because I wanted to see whether or not they were interested in approving that. Because if they don\u2019t approve something within that sphere, that means, very simply, that they\u2019re not looking to approve it at all. They want to use it for an election issue, but it\u2019s now an election issue that will go to our benefit, not their benefit. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But make no mistake: I will not rest until we have delivered for the citizens of our great country so many different things\u2014immigration, the strong military. We\u2019ve done an awfully good job of protecting our Second Amendment. That was in question during the campaign, you remember, and we have done a very, very good job. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last 12 months, I have kept one promise after another, and we\u2019re just getting started. So often I\u2019ll see\u2014and I must say, six, seven months ago, they were saying, he didn\u2019t fulfill his promise on this or that. I said, I\u2019ve only been here for four months. You know, other people were there for eight years and they would finally get something passed. I was there four months\u2014you know this, Paul\u2014and they were saying, \u201cHe didn\u2019t fulfill a promise.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now we\u2019ve fulfilled far more promises than we promised. (Laughter.) And they\u2019re having a hard time with that. We have seriously fulfilled promises. I call it \u201cpromises plus.\u201d (Laughter.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And one of the things we\u2019re doing that\u2019s so important\u2014and Mitch has worked so hard on, and Don, and everybody\u2014is the justices, the judges all over the country. We\u2019re filling up the courts with really talented people who understand and read the Constitution for what it says. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it\u2019s really not talked about that much, but it is a tremendous impact. It\u2019s having already a tremendous impact. And we have incredible people lined up\u2014just lined up\u2014that are getting ready to go into the courts. And, in many ways, Mitch, I think it\u2019s going to be one of the most important things, if not the most important thing, that we\u2019re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Defense is always the most. Got to be the most, John, right? But what we\u2019re doing with the courts, I think, is going to go down as one of the greatest achievements, so I want to thank you for that. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And not only are we protecting America at home, we\u2019re protecting our interests abroad. It\u2019s time to finally end the dangerous defense sequester. It would be wonderful if we could go back to a budget\u2014(applause)\u2014in order to fully fund our military, and do it properly and order properly, and have it over a period of time, and do it the right way. So at some point, I hope, we\u2019re going to be able to do that and it should work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in order to defeat terrorists, we\u2019re also asking Congress to ensure that we continue to have all necessary power and everything we need to defeat and detain the terrorists. We can\u2019t treat terrorists like common criminals; they are really unlawful enemy combatants. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you see what they do and the way they do it, and the level of ferocity, we can\u2019t treat them the way we do the ordinary criminal. And as you saw on Tuesday, I\u2019ve signed an order keeping open our very secure detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.) It\u2019s another promise kept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there is one more very important promise we\u2019re keeping: No longer are we making apologies for America. We don\u2019t apologize anymore. (Applause.) We\u2019re proud of our history, we\u2019re confident in our values, and we\u2019re grateful to our heroes, and we are determined to create a brighter future for all of our people. We are restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us all, as friends, as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans. Because when Americans are united, nothing\u2014nothing at all\u2014nothing can stop us. We win. (Applause.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said the other night, we are a nation that built the Empire State Building in one year. Actually, to be exact, it was\u2014we built it in less than a year. Would you believe it? Working 24 hours around the clock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We built the Hoover Dam in record time. We built the Golden Gate Bridge. We linked our nation together with railroads and highways. We dug out the Panama Canal. We\u2019re the nation that won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put satellites into space and planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. We\u2019ve healed the sick, cured disease, and cared for the poor like no other nation. We\u2019ve lifted millions into prosperity, and delivered millions into freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is our legacy. This is our birthright. And this is the foundation on which we build our very glorious future. Because together, we are, indeed, making America great again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President Trump_Speaks_2018_House_Senate_Republican_Member_Conference.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Trump addresses the Republican members of the US House and Senate, focusing on the unity within the party and its chief tenets such as strong borders, fewer regulations, and well-funded military.&nbsp;He also congratulates&nbsp;the members on passing the tax cut bill in December 2017.</p>\r\n"}
