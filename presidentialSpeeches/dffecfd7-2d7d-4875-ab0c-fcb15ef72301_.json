The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday with the extended family.\n\r\n\r\n While it was different for everyone, we all lost something.\n\r\n\r\n A collective suffering. A collective sacrifice. A year filled with the loss of life \u2014 and the loss of living for all of us.\n\r\n\r\n But, in the loss, we saw how much there was to gain in appreciation, respect, and gratitude.\n\r\n\r\n Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. In fact, it may be the most American thing we do.\n\r\n\r\n And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve seen frontline and essential workers risking their lives \u2014 sometimes losing them \u2014 to save and help others. Researchers and scientists racing for a vaccine. And so many of you, as Hemingway wrote, being strong in all the broken places.\n\r\n\r\n I know it\u2019s been hard. I truly know.\n\r\n\r\n As I\u2019ve told you before, I carry a card in my pocket with the number of Americans who have died from COVID to date. It\u2019s on the back of my schedule. As of now, the total deaths in America: 527,726. That\u2019s more deaths than in World War One, World War Two, the Vietnam War, and 9/11 combined.\n\r\n\r\n They were husbands, wives, sons and daughters, grandparents, friends, neighbors \u2014 young and old. They leave behind loved ones unable to truly grieve or to heal, even to have a funeral.\n\r\n\r\n But I\u2019m also thinking about everyone else who lost this past year to natural causes, by cruel fate of accident, or other diseases. They, too, died alone. They, too, leave loved ones behind who are hurting badly.\n\r\n\r\n You know, you\u2019ve often heard me say before, I talk about the longest walk any parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to his child\u2019s bedroom to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I lost my job. We can\u2019t be here anymore.\u201d Like my Dad told me when he lost his job in Scranton.\n\r\n\r\n So many of you have had to make that same walk this past year.\n\r\n\r\n You lost your job. You closed your business. Facing eviction, homelessness, hunger, a loss of control, and, maybe worst of all, a loss of hope.\n\r\n\r\n Watching a generation of children who may be set back up to a year or more \u2014 because they\u2019ve not been in school \u2014 because of their loss of learning.\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s the details of life that matter most, and we\u2019ve missed those details.\n\r\n\r\n The big details and small moments.\n\r\n\r\n Weddings, birthdays, graduations \u2014 all the things that needed to happen but didn\u2019t. The first date. The family reunions. The Sunday night rituals.\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s all has exacted a terrible cost on the psyche of so many of us. For we are fundamentally a people who want to be with others \u2014 to talk, to laugh, to hug, to hold one another.\n\r\n\r\n But this virus has kept us apart.\n\r\n\r\n Grandparents haven\u2019t seen their children or grandchildren. Parents haven\u2019t seen their kids. Kids haven\u2019t seen their friends.\n\r\n\r\n The things we used to do that always filled us with joy have become the things we couldn\u2019t do and broke our hearts.\n\r\n\r\n Too often, we\u2019ve turned against one another.\n\r\n\r\n A mask \u2014 the easiest thing to do to save lives \u2014 sometimes it divides us.\n\r\n\r\n States pitted against one other instead of working with each other.\n\r\n\r\n Vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated. At this very moment, so many of them \u2014 our fellow Americans \u2014 they\u2019re on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still \u2014 still \u2014 they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s un-American, and it must stop.\n\r\n\r\n Look, we know what we need to do to beat this virus: Tell the truth. Follow the scientists and the science. Work together. Put trust and faith in our government to fulfill its most important function, which is protecting the American people \u2014 no function more important.\n\r\n\r\n We need to remember the government isn\u2019t some foreign force in a distant capital. No, it\u2019s us. All of us. \u201cWe the People.\u201d For you and I, that America thrives when we give our hearts, when we turn our hands to common purpose. And right now, my friends, we are doing just that. And I have to say, as your President, I am grateful to you.\n\r\n\r\n Last summer, I was in Philadelphia, and I met a small-business owner \u2014 a woman. I asked her \u2014 I said, \u201cWhat do you need most?\u201d I\u2019ll never forget what she said to me. She said \u2014 looking me in the eye, she said, \u201cI just want the truth. The truth. Just tell me the truth.\u201d Think of that.\n\r\n\r\n My fellow Americans, you\u2019re owed nothing less than the truth.\n\r\n\r\n And for all of you asking when things will get back to normal, here is the truth: The only way to get our lives back, to get our economy back on track is to beat the virus.\n\r\n\r\n You\u2019ve been hearing me say that for \u2014 while I was running and the last 50 days I\u2019ve been President. But this is one of the most complex operations we\u2019ve under- \u2014 ever undertaken as a nation in a long time.\n\r\n\r\n That\u2019s why I\u2019m using every power I have as President of the United States to put us on a war footing to get the job done. It sounds like hyperbole, but I mean it: a war footing.\n\r\n\r\n And thank God we\u2019re making some real progress now.\n\r\n\r\n On my first full day in office, I outlined for you a comprehensive strategy to beat this pandemic. And we have spent every day since attempting to carry it out.\n\r\n\r\n Two months ago, the country \u2014 this country didn\u2019t have nearly enough vaccine supply to vaccinate all or near all of the American public. But soon we will.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve been working with the vaccine manufacturers \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson \u2014 to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson &amp; Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which is one shot.\n\r\n\r\n In fact, just yesterday, I announced \u2014 and I met with the CEOs of both companies \u2014 I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. These two companies \u2014 competitors \u2014 have come together for the good of the nation, and they should be applauded for it.\n\r\n\r\n It\u2019s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II.\n\r\n\r\n Now because of all the work we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That\u2019s months ahead of schedule.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019re mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one\u2019s arm. Calling on active duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019ve been creating more places to get the shots. We\u2019ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one \u2014 any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we\u2019ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it.\n\r\n\r\n We continue to work on making at-home testing available.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019ve been focused on serving people in the hardest-hit communities of this pandemic \u2014 Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.\n\r\n\r\n So, what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after months \u2014 only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly] 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent.\n\r\n\r\n With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 the CDC \u2014 that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC] will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with friends, and as well as travel.\n\r\n\r\n When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days in office. Tonight, I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we\u2019re going to beat that goal. Because we\u2019re actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None.\n\r\n\r\n Now I want to talk about the next steps we\u2019re thinking about.\n\r\n\r\n First, tonight, I\u2019m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes, and territories to make all adults \u2014 people 18 and over \u2014 eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.\n\r\n\r\n Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That\u2019s much earlier than expected.\n\r\n\r\n Let me be clear: That doesn\u2019t mean everyone\u2019s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you\u2019ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.\n\r\n\r\n To do this, we\u2019re going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintaining \u2014 beating our current pace of two million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.\n\r\n\r\n Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.\n\r\n\r\n Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan \u2014 and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it \u2014 and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about 100 million shots, of opening the majority of K-8 schools in my first 100 days in office. This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona.\n\r\n\r\n Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.\n\r\n\r\n And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that\u2019s not hyperbole. I need you.\n\r\n\r\n I need you to get vaccinated when it\u2019s your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well.\n\r\n\r\n Because here\u2019s the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there\u2019s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn\u2019t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.\n\r\n\r\n After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.\n\r\n\r\n But to get there, we can\u2019t let our guard down.\n\r\n\r\n This fight is far from order \u2014 from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, \u201cI will tell you the truth.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n A July 4th with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal \u2014 a lot can happen; conditions can change.\n\r\n\r\n The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019ve got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.\n\r\n\r\n So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He has assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they\u2019re safe. Vice President Harris and I know they\u2019re safe. That\u2019s why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so \u2014 for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated.\n\r\n\r\n Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors \u2014 the people you know best who\u2019ve gotten the vaccine.\n\r\n\r\n We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC.\n\r\n\r\n Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.\n\r\n\r\n And national unity isn\u2019t just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don\u2019t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don\u2019t want to do again.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ll close with this.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve lost so much over the last year.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve lost family and friends.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve lost businesses and dreams we spent years building.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve lost time \u2014 time with each other.\n\r\n\r\n And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this \u2014 this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies.\n\r\n\r\n You know, and there\u2019s something else we lost.\n\r\n\r\n We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people.\n\r\n\r\n But as I stand here tonight, we\u2019re proving once again something I have said time and time again until they\u2019re probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It\u2019s never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back.\n\r\n\r\n The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished.\n\r\n\r\n And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another.\n\r\n\r\n And today, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks \u2014 payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check \u2014 a Treasury check.\n\r\n\r\n It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers healthcare premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it fi- \u2014 and it funds all the steps I\u2019ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.\n\r\n\r\n In the coming weeks and months, I\u2019ll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any pa-, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not.\n\r\n\r\n About how after a long, dark years \u2014 one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead.\n\r\n\r\n If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we will have proven once again that this country can do anything \u2014 hard things, big things, important things.\n\r\n\r\n Over a year ago, no one could\u2019ve imagined what we were about to go through, but now we\u2019re coming through it, and it\u2019s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we\u2019re also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.\n\r\n\r\n My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we\u2019ll come together as one people, one nation, one America.\n\r\n\r\n I believe we can and we will. We\u2019re seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation\u2019s history \u2014 darkest we\u2019ve ever known.\n\r\n\r\n I promise you, we\u2019ll come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country.\n\r\n\r\n This is the United States of America, and there is nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 from the bottom of my heart, I believe this \u2014 there is nothing we can\u2019t do when we do it together.\n\r\n\r\n So God bless you all.\n\r\n\r\n And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone.\n\r\n\r\n And may God protect our troops.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you for taking the time to listen.\n\r\n\r\n I look forward to seeing you.", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Good evening, my fellow Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight, I\u2019d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were taken in another era.

But soon we will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve been working with the vaccine manufacturers \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson \u2014 to manufacture and purchase hundreds of millions of doses of these three safe, effective vaccines. And now, at the direction and with the assistance of my administration, Johnson &amp; Johnson is working together with a competitor, Merck, to speed up and increase the capacity to manufacture new Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, which is one shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, just yesterday, I announced \u2014 and I met with the CEOs of both companies \u2014 I announced our plan to buy an additional 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. These two companies \u2014 competitors \u2014 have come together for the good of the nation, and they should be applauded for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s truly a national effort, just like we saw during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now because of all the work we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ll have enough vaccine supply for all adults in America by the end of May. That\u2019s months ahead of schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019re mobilizing thousands of vaccinators to put the vaccine in one\u2019s arm. Calling on active duty military, FEMA, retired doctors and nurses, administrators, and those to administer the shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019ve been creating more places to get the shots. We\u2019ve made it possible for you to get a vaccine at nearly one \u2014 any one of nearly 10,000 pharmacies across the country, just like you get your flu shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re also working with governors and mayors, in red states and blue states, to set up and support nearly 600 federally supported vaccination centers that administer hundreds of thousands of shots per day. You can drive up to a stadium or a large parking lot, get your shot, never leave your car, and drive home in less than an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve been sending vaccines to hundreds of community health centers all across America, located in underserved areas. And we\u2019ve been deploying and we will deploy more mobile vehicles and pop-up clinics to meet you where you live so those who are least able to get the vaccine are able to get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue to work on making at-home testing available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019ve been focused on serving people in the hardest-hit communities of this pandemic \u2014 Black, Latino, Native American, and rural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what does all this add up to? When I took office 50 days ago, only 8 percent of Americans after months \u2014 only 8 percent of those over the age of 65 had gotten their first vaccination. Today, that number is [nearly] 65 percent. Just 14 percent of Americans over the age 75, 50 days ago, had gotten their first shot. Today, that number is well over 70 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 the CDC \u2014 that came out on Monday, it means simply this: Millions and millions of grandparents who went months without being able to hug their grandkids can now do so. And the more people who are fully vaccinated, the CD [CDC] will continue to provide guidance on what you can do in the workplace, places of worship, with friends, and as well as travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I came into office, you may recall, I set a goal that many of you said was, kind of, way over the top. I said I intended to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days in office. Tonight, I can say we are not only going to meet that goal, we\u2019re going to beat that goal. Because we\u2019re actually on track to reach this goal of 100 million shots in arms on my 60th day in office. No other country in the world has done this. None.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I want to talk about the next steps we\u2019re thinking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, tonight, I\u2019m announcing that I will direct all states, tribes, and territories to make all adults \u2014 people 18 and over \u2014 eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me say that again: All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That\u2019s much earlier than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me be clear: That doesn\u2019t mean everyone\u2019s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you\u2019ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this, we\u2019re going to go from a million shots a day that I promised in December, before I was sworn in, to maintaining \u2014 beating our current pace of two million shots a day, outpacing the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, at the time when every adult is eligible in May, we will launch, with our partners, new tools to make it easier for you to find the vaccine and where to get the shot, including a new website that will help you first find the place to get vaccinated and the one nearest you. No more searching day and night for an appointment for you and your loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, with the passage of the American Rescue Plan \u2014 and I thank again the House and Senate for passing it \u2014 and my announcement last month of a plan to vaccinate teachers and school staff, including bus drivers, we can accelerate the massive, nationwide effort to reopen our schools safely and meet my goal, that I stated at the same time about 100 million shots, of opening the majority of K-8 schools in my first 100 days in office. This is going to be the number one priority of my new Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth, in the coming weeks, we will issue further guidance on what you can and cannot do once fully vaccinated, to lessen the confusion, to keep people safe, and encourage more people to get vaccinated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, fifth, and maybe most importantly: I promise I will do everything in my power, I will not relent until we beat this virus, but I need you, the American people. I need you. I need every American to do their part. And that\u2019s not hyperbole. I need you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I need you to get vaccinated when it\u2019s your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family and friends and neighbors get vaccinated as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because here\u2019s the point: If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there\u2019s a good chance you, your families, and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout and a barbeque and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn\u2019t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this long hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation, but we begin to mark our independence from this virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But to get there, we can\u2019t let our guard down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fight is far from order \u2014 from over. As I told the woman in Pennsylvania, \u201cI will tell you the truth.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A July 4th with your loved ones is the goal. But a goal \u2014 a lot can happen; conditions can change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientists have made clear that things may get worse again as new variants of the virus spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019ve got work to do to ensure everyone has confidence in the safety and effectiveness of all three vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So my message to you is this: Listen to Dr. Fauci, one of the most distinguished and trusted voices in the world. He has assured us the vaccines are safe. They underwent rigorous scientific review. I know they\u2019re safe. Vice President Harris and I know they\u2019re safe. That\u2019s why we got the vaccine publicly in front of cameras so \u2014 for the world to see, so you could see us do it. The First Lady and the Second Gentleman also got vaccinated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk to your family, your friends, your neighbors \u2014 the people you know best who\u2019ve gotten the vaccine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need everyone to get vaccinated. We need everyone to keep washing their hands, stay socially distanced, and keep wearing the masks as recommended by the CDC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because even if we devote every resource we have, beating this virus and getting back to normal depends on national unity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And national unity isn\u2019t just how politics and politicians vote in Washington or what the loudest voices say on cable or online. Unity is what we do together as fellow Americans. Because if we don\u2019t stay vigilant and the conditions change, then we may have to reinstate restrictions to get back on track. And, please, we don\u2019t want to do again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve made so much progress. This is not the time to let up. Just as we are emerging from a dark winter into a hopeful spring and summer is not the time to not stick with the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ll close with this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve lost so much over the last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve lost family and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve lost businesses and dreams we spent years building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve lost time \u2014 time with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And our children have lost so much time with their friends, time with their schools. No graduation ceremonies this \u2014 this spring. No graduations from college, high school, moving-up ceremonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, and there\u2019s something else we lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We lost faith in whether our government and our democracy can deliver on really hard things for the American people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as I stand here tonight, we\u2019re proving once again something I have said time and time again until they\u2019re probably tired of hearing me say it. I say it foreign leaders and domestic alike: It\u2019s never, ever a good bet to bet against the American people. America is coming back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development, manufacture, and distribution of the vaccines in record time is a true miracle of science. It is one of the most extraordinary achievements any country has ever accomplished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we also just saw the Perseverance rover land on Mars. Stunning images of our dreams that are now a reality. Another example of the extraordinary American ingenuity, commitment, and belief in science and one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And today, I signed into law the American Rescue Plan, an historic piece of legislation that delivers immediate relief to millions of people. It includes $1,400 in direct rescue checks \u2014 payments. That means a typical family of four earning about $110,000 will get checks for $5,600 deposited if they have direct deposit or in a check \u2014 a Treasury check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It extends unemployment benefits. It helps small businesses. It lowers healthcare premiums for many. It provides food and nutrition, keeps families in their homes. And it will cut child poverty in this country in half, according to the experts. And it fi- \u2014 and it funds all the steps I\u2019ve just described to beat the virus and create millions of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming weeks and months, I\u2019ll be traveling, along with the First Lady, the Vice President, the Second Gentleman and members of my Cabinet, to speak directly to you, to tell you the truth about how the American Rescue Plan meets the moment. And if it fails at any pa-, I will acknowledge that it failed. But it will not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About how after a long, dark years \u2014 one whole year, there is hope and light of better days ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we all do our part, this country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, our kids will be back in school, and we will have proven once again that this country can do anything \u2014 hard things, big things, important things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over a year ago, no one could\u2019ve imagined what we were about to go through, but now we\u2019re coming through it, and it\u2019s a shared experience that binds us together as a nation. We are bound together by the loss and the pain of the days that have gone by. But we\u2019re also bound together by the hope and the possibilities of the days in front of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My fervent prayer for our country is that, after all we have been through, we\u2019ll come together as one people, one nation, one America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe we can and we will. We\u2019re seizing this moment. And history, I believe, will record: We faced and overcame one of the toughest and darkest periods in this nation\u2019s history \u2014 darkest we\u2019ve ever known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I promise you, we\u2019ll come out stronger with a renewed faith in ourselves, a renewed commitment to one another, to our communities, and to our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the United States of America, and there is nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 from the bottom of my heart, I believe this \u2014 there is nothing we can\u2019t do when we do it together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So God bless you all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And please, God, give solace to all those people who lost someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And may God protect our troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look forward to seeing you.</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Biden_Remarks_Anniversary_Coronavirus_Shutdown.mp3", "introduction": "<p>On the first anniversary of the shutdown due to Covid-19, President Joe Biden gives his first prime-time televised address to the American people.
