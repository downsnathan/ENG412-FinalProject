Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.\n\r\n\r\n This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I\u2019ve been\u2014as we\u2019ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.\n\r\n\r\n He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.\n\r\n\r\n He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.\n\r\n\r\n For weeks\u2014for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it\u2019s unfolding largely as we predicted.\n\r\n\r\n In the past week, we\u2019ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.\n\r\n\r\n Rus-\u2014the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.\n\r\n\r\n We saw a staged political theater in Moscow\u2014outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was\u2014Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide\u2014without any evidence.\n\r\n\r\n We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.\n\r\n\r\n And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.\n\r\n\r\n Within moments\u2014moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.\n\r\n\r\n Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve been transparent with the world. We\u2019ve shared declassified evidence about Russia\u2019s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.\n\r\n\r\n Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.\n\r\n\r\n Today, I\u2019m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.\n\r\n\r\n This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.\n\r\n\r\n We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we\u2019ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.\n\r\n\r\n Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy\u2014as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others\u2014to amplify the joint impact of our response.\n\r\n\r\n I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia\u2019s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus-\u2014the Russian military.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re going to impose major\u2014and we\u2019re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia\u2019s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever\u2014ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government\u2019s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.\n\r\n\r\n In today\u2019s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve cut off Russia\u2019s largest bank\u2014a bank that holds more than one third of Russia\u2019s banking assets by itself\u2014cut it off from the US financial system.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And today, we\u2019re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.\n\r\n\r\n As promised, we\u2019re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning\u2014that we\u2019re sanctioning as well.\n\r\n\r\n As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin\u2019s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.\n\r\n\r\n On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from US or European investors.\n\r\n\r\n Now, we\u2019re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises\u2014companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.\n\r\n\r\n Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia\u2019s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.\n\r\n\r\n Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we\u2019ll cut off more than half of Russia\u2019s high-tech imports.\n\r\n\r\n It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It\u2019ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin\u2019s long-term strategic ambitions.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we\u2019re imposing, we\u2019re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.\n\r\n\r\n Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit\u2014we\u2019ll be there\u2014to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.\n\r\n\r\n Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year\u2014this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.\n\r\n\r\n As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.\n\r\n\r\n There is no doubt\u2014no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.\n\r\n\r\n Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.\n\r\n\r\n On Tuesday, in response to Russia\u2019s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I\u2019ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO\u2019s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.\n\r\n\r\n Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding\u2014the other Allies, the rest of NATO\u2014adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.\n\r\n\r\n And today, within hours of Russia\u2019s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated\u2014an activation of response plans.\n\r\n\r\n This will enable NATO\u2019s high-readiness forces to deploy and\u2014when and where they\u2019re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.\n\r\n\r\n And now I\u2019m authorizing additional US forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO\u2019s response, including some of US-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world\u2014NATO.\n\r\n\r\n As we respond, my administration is using the tools\u2014every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.\n\r\n\r\n You know, we\u2019re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not\u2014should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.\n\r\n\r\n You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.\n\r\n\r\n We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.\n\r\n\r\n We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.\n\r\n\r\n I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.\n\r\n\r\n But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.\n\r\n\r\n Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.\n\r\n\r\n For months, we have been working closely with our private\u2014with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.\n\r\n\r\n I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We\u2019ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.\n\r\n\r\n And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.\n\r\n\r\n But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil\u2014mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.\n\r\n\r\n The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.\n\r\n\r\n This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a\u2014has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.\n\r\n\r\n But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin\u2014and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin\u2019s desire for empire by any means necessary\u2014by bullying Russia\u2019s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.\n\r\n\r\n Putin\u2019s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world\u2014one where nations take what they want by force.\n\r\n\r\n But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.\n\r\n\r\n The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.\n\r\n\r\n And Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly\u2014economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia\u2019s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.\n\r\n\r\n When the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.\n\r\n\r\n Liberty, democracy, human dignity\u2014these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people\u2014from people\u2019s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.\n\r\n\r\n God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.\n\r\n\r\n Q: President Biden \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?\n\r\n\r\n Q: What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s a large conflict already. The way we\u2019re going to assure it\u2019s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it\u2019s ever been.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And I have no plans to talk with Putin.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, you didn\u2019t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the US isn\u2019t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence\u2014maybe more consequence than SWIFT\u2014number one.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that\u2019s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Cecilia Ve-\u2014Vega, ABC.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?\n\r\n\r\n And a second question I\u2019ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will\u2014that the We-\u2014the threat that he gave\u2014the West \u201cwill face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.\u201d Is he threatening a nuclear strike?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he\u2019s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh-\u2014this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what\u2019s coming and so the people of Russia know what he\u2019s brought on them. That\u2019s what this is all about.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n This is going to take time. It\u2019s not going to occur\u2014he\u2019s going to say, \u201cOh my God, these sanctions are coming. I\u2019m going to stand down.\u201d&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n He\u2019s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n Q: Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President\u2014Mr. President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?\n\r\n\r\n And I do have one more question.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there\u2019s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there\u2019s no doubt about that, number one.\n\r\n\r\n Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we\u2019re going to impose on Russia, period.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n What\u2019s your next question? I\u2019m sorry.\n\r\n\r\n Q: The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a \u201cworthy adversary\u201d?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was\u2014I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was \u201cworthy.\u201d I didn\u2019t underestimate him.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And I\u2019ve read most of everything he\u2019s written. Did you read the\u2014I shouldn\u2019t sa-\u2014I\u2019m not being a wise guy. The\u2014you heard the speech he made\u2014almost an hour\u2019s worth of speeches\u2014why he was going into Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That\u2019s what this is about.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And I think that his\u2014his ambitions are\u2014are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.\n\r\n\r\n Q: President Biden\u2014President Biden \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: And\u2014and with that\u2014with his ambitions, you\u2019re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say sanctions couldn\u2019t stop him.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But you\u2019ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Okay, but \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re two different things. And we\u2019re now going to\u2014he\u2019s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And what will that do\u2014how will that change his mindset here, given he\u2019s attacking Ukraine as we speak?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he\u2019ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you\u2019re prepared to take? And if not \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not a bluff; it\u2019s on the table.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sanctioning President Putin?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you\u2019re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what\u2019s called \u201cSWIFT\u201d\u2014the international banking system\u2014or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we\u2019ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that\u2019s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let\u2019s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they\u2019re working.\n\r\n\r\n Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Let me ask you about\u2014can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: What\u2019s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in US and Russian relations?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in US-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they\u2019re on.\n\r\n\r\n And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he\u2019s doing\u2014from Asia to South America to Europe to acr-\u2014around the world.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n And so, it\u2019s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea\u2014you don\u2019t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And are you\u2014are you\u2014if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n No, no, no. He\u2019s had his hand up a long time.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the US will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved\u2014we will be involved. The only thing that I\u2019m convinced of is: If we don\u2019t stop now, he\u2019ll be emboldened. If we don\u2019t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.\n\r\n\r\n Look, you know, every\u2014well, anyway.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And can you talk anything more about your conversation \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States\u2014is India with\u2014fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to be\u2014we\u2019re in consultation with\u2014with India today. We haven\u2019t resolved that completely.\n\r\n\r\n Q: One more question \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n &nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n &nbsp;", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon.

And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government\u2019s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today\u2019s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve cut off Russia\u2019s largest bank\u2014a bank that holds more than one third of Russia\u2019s banking assets by itself\u2014cut it off from the US financial system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And today, we\u2019re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As promised, we\u2019re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning\u2014that we\u2019re sanctioning as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin\u2019s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from US or European investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, we\u2019re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises\u2014companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia\u2019s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we\u2019ll cut off more than half of Russia\u2019s high-tech imports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It\u2019ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin\u2019s long-term strategic ambitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we\u2019re imposing, we\u2019re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit\u2014we\u2019ll be there\u2014to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year\u2014this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no doubt\u2014no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Tuesday, in response to Russia\u2019s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I\u2019ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO\u2019s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding\u2014the other Allies, the rest of NATO\u2014adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And today, within hours of Russia\u2019s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated\u2014an activation of response plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will enable NATO\u2019s high-readiness forces to deploy and\u2014when and where they\u2019re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now I\u2019m authorizing additional US forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO\u2019s response, including some of US-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world\u2014NATO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we respond, my administration is using the tools\u2014every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, we\u2019re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not\u2014should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For months, we have been working closely with our private\u2014with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We\u2019ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil\u2014mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a\u2014has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin\u2014and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin\u2019s desire for empire by any means necessary\u2014by bullying Russia\u2019s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putin\u2019s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world\u2014one where nations take what they want by force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Putin\u2019s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly\u2014economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia\u2019s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the history of this era is written, Putin\u2019s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liberty, democracy, human dignity\u2014these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people\u2014from people\u2019s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: President Biden \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s a large conflict already. The way we\u2019re going to assure it\u2019s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it\u2019s ever been.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I have no plans to talk with Putin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, you didn\u2019t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the US isn\u2019t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence\u2014maybe more consequence than SWIFT\u2014number one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that\u2019s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cecilia Ve-\u2014Vega, ABC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a second question I\u2019ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will\u2014that the We-\u2014the threat that he gave\u2014the West \u201cwill face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.\u201d Is he threatening a nuclear strike?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he\u2019s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh-\u2014this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what\u2019s coming and so the people of Russia know what he\u2019s brought on them. That\u2019s what this is all about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is going to take time. It\u2019s not going to occur\u2014he\u2019s going to say, \u201cOh my God, these sanctions are coming. I\u2019m going to stand down.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He\u2019s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President\u2014Mr. President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I do have one more question.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there\u2019s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there\u2019s no doubt about that, number one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we\u2019re going to impose on Russia, period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What\u2019s your next question? I\u2019m sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a \u201cworthy adversary\u201d?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was\u2014I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was \u201cworthy.\u201d I didn\u2019t underestimate him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I\u2019ve read most of everything he\u2019s written. Did you read the\u2014I shouldn\u2019t sa-\u2014I\u2019m not being a wise guy. The\u2014you heard the speech he made\u2014almost an hour\u2019s worth of speeches\u2014why he was going into Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That\u2019s what this is about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I think that his\u2014his ambitions are\u2014are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: President Biden\u2014President Biden \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And\u2014and with that\u2014with his ambitions, you\u2019re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t say sanctions couldn\u2019t stop him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But you\u2019ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Okay, but \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re two different things. And we\u2019re now going to\u2014he\u2019s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And what will that do\u2014how will that change his mindset here, given he\u2019s attacking Ukraine as we speak?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he\u2019ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you\u2019re prepared to take? And if not \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s not a bluff; it\u2019s on the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sanctioning President Putin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you\u2019re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what\u2019s called \u201cSWIFT\u201d\u2014the international banking system\u2014or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we\u2019ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that\u2019s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let\u2019s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they\u2019re working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Let me ask you about\u2014can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What\u2019s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in US and Russian relations?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in US-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they\u2019re on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he\u2019s doing\u2014from Asia to South America to Europe to acr-\u2014around the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so, it\u2019s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea\u2014you don\u2019t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And are you\u2014are you\u2014if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, no, no. He\u2019s had his hand up a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the US will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved\u2014we will be involved. The only thing that I\u2019m convinced of is: If we don\u2019t stop now, he\u2019ll be emboldened. If we don\u2019t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, you know, every\u2014well, anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And can you talk anything more about your conversation \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States\u2014is India with\u2014fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to be\u2014we\u2019re in consultation with\u2014with India today. We haven\u2019t resolved that completely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: One more question \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/biden_russia_ukriane_2022_02_24.mp3", "introduction": "<p>President Biden gives a statement after President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered the invasion of the country of Ukraine.
