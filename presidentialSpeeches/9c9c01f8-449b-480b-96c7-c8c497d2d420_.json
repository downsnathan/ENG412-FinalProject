My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We\u2019re speaking with the governors and representatives. FEMA is already on its way, and they got there\u2014as soon as we heard the word, I said, \u201cGet out there.\u201d So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does. It\u2019s, really, something very special.&nbsp;\n\r\n\r\n So we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we\u2019re with you all the way. It\u2019s a tough deal. That was a bad, bed level five. That was a bad group. That\u2019s as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes. Something that\u2019s something incredible, the power\u2014the horrible, destructive power.\n\r\n\r\n America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide. Flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It\u2019s been incredible what they\u2019ve done.\n\r\n\r\n You looked at the charts, and the charts are\u2014and the models from early on\u2014predictions were 100 [thousand] and 120,000 people look like. If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we\u2019re going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it\u2019s still just a horrible thing all over the world. A hundred and eighty-four countries.\n\r\n\r\n This is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you very much. Tony, please.\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Thank you, Mr. President. Just one\u2014a couple of things, and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday.\n\r\n\r\n You\u2019re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we\u2019ve been talking about and how things are starting to balance off. And I think the more, as we go by each day, I think we\u2019re going to see\u2014and again, I never like to get ahead of myself or of Dr. Birx, but it looks like even though we\u2019ve had a really bad week last week\u2014remember, when I was speaking to you before, I was saying this was really a bad week\u2014there\u2019s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we\u2019re starting to see in some areas now that kind of flattening, particularly in a place that was a hotspot like New York. That\u2019s the first thing.\n\r\n\r\n The second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning, for about an hour, and they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range, about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, but specifically African American.\n\r\n\r\n And, I mean, I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are, to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification, where proper and where appropriate, to isolate and contact trace if we can, but also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately.\n\r\n\r\n So I just wanted to get that out of the way.\n\r\n\r\n The other point I wanted to make is that I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question. And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it\u2019s what \u201cwould have\u201d or \u201ccould have.\u201d The nature of the hypothetical question was: If, in fact, we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved? And the answer to my question was, as I always do\u2014and I\u2019m doing right now\u2014perfectly honestly say, \u201cyes.\u201d I mean, obviously. If you\u2014mitigation helps.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works. So if mitigation works, and you instigated and\u2014you initiated earlier, you will probably have saved more lives. If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives, if you initiated at a certain time.\n\r\n\r\n That was taken as a way that maybe, somehow, something was at fault here.\n\r\n\r\n So let me tell you from my experience\u2014and I can only speak from my own experience\u2014is that we had been talking, before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness or not, of strong mitigations. So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean.\n\r\n\r\n The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to actually have a, quote, \u201cshutdown\u201d in the sense of\u2014not really \u201cshutdown\u201d but to really have strong mitigation, we discussed it. Obviously, there would be concern by some that, in fact, that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the President listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.\n\r\n\r\n The next second time that I went with Dr. Birx in\u2014to the President and said, \u201cFifteen days are not enough. We need to go thirty days,\u201d obviously, there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects. Nonetheless, at that time, the President went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days.\n\r\n\r\n So I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were. But, clearly, as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn\u2019t have the chance to clarify.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n Q: The date on that?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Excuse me?\n\r\n\r\n Q: The date.\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: You know, to be honest with you, I don\u2019t even remember what the date was. But I can just tell you the first and only time that I went in and said we should do mitigation strongly, the response was, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Q: And what did he do? Was that the travel restrictions?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: No. The travel restriction is separate. That was whether or not we wanted to go into a mitigation stage of 15 days of mitigation. The travel was another recommendation, when we went in and said, \u201cWe probably should be doing that.\u201d And the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d And then another time was, \u201cWe should do it with Europe,\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d And the next time, \u201cWe should do it with the UK,\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Q: In this interview, you said there was pushback.\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Where did that pushback come from?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: No, it wasn\u2019t\u2014that was the wrong choice of words. You know what it was? When people discuss, not necessarily in front of the President\u2014when people discuss, they say, \u201cWell, you know, this is going to have maybe a harmful effect on this or on that.\u201d So it was a poor choice of words. There wasn\u2019t anybody saying, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Q: Are you doing this voluntarily? Or did the President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: No, I\u2019m doing it \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014or Vice President ask you to do this?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Everything I do is voluntarily. Please. Don\u2019t even imply that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So, Mr. President, the question is \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And, by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. The travel ban was done earlier.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You couldn\u2019t give us a date when he talked to you.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And if you look at statistics\u2014I happened to write a couple of them down. If you look at statistics\u2014so, on January 6th\u2014that\u2019s long before the dates you\u2019re talking about\u2014there were\u2014CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice, before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That\u2019s on January 6th. This is all documented. Because we have so much fake news, I like to document things. January 6th, long before the dates we\u2019re talking about, CDC issued travel notice to Wuhan\u2014for Wuhan.\n\r\n\r\n On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don\u2019t have any cases. So there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a level one travel notice health\u2014for health, while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I\u2019m supposed to close down the economy\u2014the greatest economy in the history of the world\u2014and we don\u2019t have one case confirmed in the United States. That\u2019s January 11th.\n\r\n\r\n On January 17th, the CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn\u2019t a case, and the fake news is saying, \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t act fast enough.\u201d Well, you remember what happened. Because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by Sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats and some others\u2014not too many others, actually. So that\u2014by the media, definitely.\n\r\n\r\n Now, on January 21st\u2014this is long before the time we\u2019re talking, because when Tony is talking, I believe he\u2019s talking about the end of February. On January 21st, okay\u2014still early\u2014there was one case of the virus. At that time, we called it the \u201cWuhan virus,\u201d right? Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We have one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from you people.\n\r\n\r\n On January 21st, the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That\u2019s why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States. You know they used the ad, \u201cThere\u2019s only one person\u2026\u201d That statement was made at that time. One case. In the whole United States, one case. I\u2019m supposed to shut down the government? The biggest\u2014the biggest economy in the history of the world. \u201cShut it down. We have one case.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Seven cases were on January 31st. Now, on January 21st, there was a case. Not one person had died. You heard that, Steve, right? Not one person.\n\r\n\r\n So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world\u2014bigger than China\u2019s, by a lot\u2014right?\u2014because of what we\u2019ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had; the highest employment numbers; the best employment numbers; best unemployment numbers also. The best of everything.\n\r\n\r\n So, on January 31st\u2014think of it\u2014not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, Jon. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find any. This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news\u2014which doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because they don\u2019t tell the truth. But CDC reported: January 31st, not one person has died.<br />\r\nAnd I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died, and I issued. You can\u2019t get earlier than that.\n\r\n\r\n So we have nobody died, and I said, \u201cChina, you can\u2019t come in. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Because I saw what was going on. It wasn\u2019t so much what I was told; it was that I saw what was going on and I didn\u2019t like it. But I didn\u2019t speak to Tony about it. Didn\u2019t speak to very many people about it. I didn\u2019t like it.\n\r\n\r\n So what did I do? Ready? January 31st: In the United States, not one person had died because of the\u2014again, the Wuhan virus. So I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died, and I got brutalized over it by the press because I was way too early; I shouldn\u2019t have done it. Brutalized by the press. But, you know, sort of\u2014I\u2019ve been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics. But I guess I\u2019m doing okay because, to the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the President of the United States, despite the things that are said.\n\r\n\r\n So, then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats and the media called \u201cxenophobic.\u201d Now, Joe Biden said, \u201cHe\u2019s a racist.\u201d He called me a racist because I said, \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down entry from China. We\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d He called me xenophobic, and he called me racist and other things.\n\r\n\r\n Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a state-\u2014it wasn\u2019t him; he didn\u2019t write it. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t even know that it was issued. But the people from his campaign\u2014who are smart. The people that write those little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good. Not the best, but they\u2019re not bad. But they issued a statement, saying that Joe Biden agrees that the Pres-\u2014that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now, he did that.\n\r\n\r\n Now, he issued it on Friday night. We\u2019ve all heard about that, Jon\u2014Friday nights, right? In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday night. Okay?\n\r\n\r\n Q: (Inaudible) seems pretty late.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: So he did\u2014he did it pretty late. I mean, you know, like at 11 o\u2019clock in the evening or something. You know, that\u2019s pretty late. Anyway. So Joe Biden issued\u2014and it\u2019s one of those things.\n\r\n\r\n But, in February, Nancy Pelosi said we should come to Chinatown. This is late February. \u201cCome to Chinatown. We think it\u2019s very safe. Come here. Let\u2019s all have the big parade\u2014Chinatown parade.\u201d Probably referring to San Francisco. And that\u2019s it.\n\r\n\r\n But I took this action early. And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It\u2019s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday\u2014hopefully in five years, when I\u2019m not here\u2014those papers are all going out of business because nobody is going to want to read them. But now they like them because they write about me.\n\r\n\r\n Now, with that, I have a couple of interesting\u2014we have a few clips that we\u2019re just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you\u2019ll find them interesting. And then we\u2019ll answer some questions. I\u2019ll ask you some questions because you\u2019re so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we\u2019re going to get back onto the reason we\u2019re here, which is the success we\u2019re having. Okay?\n\r\n\r\n Please, you could put it on. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n (A video is played.)\n\r\n\r\n So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors\u2014including Democratic or \u201cDemocrat,\u201d as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn\u2019t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it\u2019s\u2014you know, it\u2019s very sad when people write false stories like, in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from the New York Times, which is a highly\u2014I mean, if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they\u2019ll end up going out of business. So it\u2019s too bad.\n\r\n\r\n But we could have given you\u2014you saw the statements. We have hundreds of statements. Hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors.\n\r\n\r\n And if you look, they were all saying, \u201cWe need ventilators. We need\u2026\u201d You don\u2019t hear \u201cventilators\u201d anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for too many. You don\u2019t need that.\u201d And, in all fairness, these two people right here\u2014Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci\u2014they said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they need that many ventilators.\u201d And I said, \u201cI agree.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n At one point\u2014and I\u2019m not knocking New York for this, but they were asking\u2014you remember?\u201440,000 ventilators. And that\u2019s more than they have all over the country. And we got them a lot of ventilators, and nobody has complained.\n\r\n\r\n We got them, as you know, beautiful\u2014we built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, \u201cYou know what? You don\u2019t have to build a second hospital.\u201d Because good news is happening. They\u2019re not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one; it was perfect. We\u2019re getting\u2014we\u2019re just starting the other. I called him up. I said, \u201cDo you think we should build the second one? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d He said, \u201cLet me get back.\u201d He got back. We didn\u2019t need it.\n\r\n\r\n With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done. And we built 2,900 incredible beds. Incredible. Then we make it\u2014we made it COVID\u2014and\u2014or, to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, and\u2014which was a lot of work. We had to change the ductwork. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work. And we had it\u2014but they never really had too much use for it.\n\r\n\r\n And they called also\u2014Mayor de Blasio, rightfully, he called. He said, \u201cWould it be possible to get more medical help?\u201d So, now, not only are we building facilities, we\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re asking us for help because they\u2019re unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help.\n\r\n\r\n Then, when the Javits Center wasn\u2019t used much\u2014and then, as you know, the Mercy\u2014and we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort, and we made them both\u2014Los Angeles and New York\u2014we made them COVID-adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn\u2019t get almost any people sent there. They didn\u2019t need them at the beginning because they didn\u2019t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything.\n\r\n\r\n And what we did was like an incredible job, but they didn\u2019t need them. It turned out\u2014they were there. We were ready. You know the expression? They have an expression: \u201cReady, willing, and able.\u201d We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What\u2014what FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did.\n\r\n\r\n So I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, \u201cCould you help us even more with medical personnel?\u201d And we sent\u2014I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts. Real experts. And I got a call from the mayor and he said, \u201cI want to tell you: Incredible\u2014these people are incredible.\u201d He said, \u201cThey lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He\u2019s\u2014he was unbelievable, what he said. It was really appreciated. And I let them know that. I let the military people\u2014he said, \u201cThey went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories, you\u2014nobody\u2014nobody acknowledges this. And it doesn\u2019t have to be acknowledged, from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors, nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA\u2014all these people, they\u2019ve done this incredible job. And they shouldn\u2019t be abused because\u2014you take a look at what\u2019s happened. Nobody is asking for ventilators, except outside of our country.\n\r\n\r\n Outside of our country, they\u2019re calling me\u2014every country. They\u2019re calling me. So many countries. And I\u2019m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody is asking for ventilators. Nobody is asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks.\n\r\n\r\n The job they\u2019ve done is incredible. With all of that being said, I\u2019m getting along very well with governors. And if I wouldn\u2019t, Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10. I said, \u201cHow was it?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a 10.\u201d He was one of my expressions, actually. But he said it was like a 10.\n\r\n\r\n And I\u2019m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren\u2019t supposed to be. But you were sitting in somebody\u2019s office listening to it, because every time we have these\u2014and, you know, and you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good. But there wasn\u2019t a raised voice. There wasn\u2019t even a statement of like, \u201cWe think you should do this or that.\u201d I heard it was, like, just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They\u2019ll say, \u201cI thought that somebody maybe slightly raised\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t even raise a voice.\n\r\n\r\n My only point of saying this, because I want to get back to why we\u2019re here: The press has not treated these incredible people who\u2019ve done such a great job, they haven\u2019t treated them fairly. They\u2019re way off. We were way ahead of schedule.\n\r\n\r\n And remember this\u2014because the Times story was a fake\u2014but everything\u2014remember this: Everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, it would have been\u2014you would have been critic-\u2014if I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized\u2014you know, criticized for being way too early.\n\r\n\r\n So, with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I\u2019ve educated a lot of people as to the press. And I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, Jon, there\u2019d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work\u2014and I don\u2019t mind being criticized, but not when they\u2019re wrong. Not when people have done a great job.\n\r\n\r\n Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Can I just ask you about the video? Because I\u2019ve never seen a video like that played in this room. It looks a bit like a campaign ad. Who\u2014who produced that video for you?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by\u2014we just put some clips together.&nbsp; I could give you\u2014I\u2019ll bet you I have over 100 more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just\u2014oh, we have far better than that. That\u2019s nothing compared to some of them.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But this was produced here in the White House by \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Why did you feel the need to do that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Because we\u2019re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They\u2019re saying what a great job we\u2019re doing, and the media\u2014these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York.\n\r\n\r\n Look, in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators\u2014we\u2019re going to be probably\u2014we didn\u2019t\u2014they didn\u2019t have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of\u2014thousands, but we got them a tremendous number of ventilator. You don\u2019t hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I\u2019m happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s good news, not bad news. I\u2019m\u2014you know, I\u2019m not saying, \u201cGee, I wish more people were there.\u201d I don\u2019t want more people there.\n\r\n\r\n We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort. And the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all\u2014the coronavirus. It was not supposed to be for that at all. They called, they said, \u201cCould we have it?\u201d That was a number of weeks ago. We said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you need it, but if you need it, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d Then they said, \u201cCould you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?\u201d We said, \u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, we will.\u201d And we did. There were military personnel. That\u2019s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to, in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery. They\u2019re great people, the military people.\n\r\n\r\n And we pieced that together\u2014I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in house.\n\r\n\r\n Steve?\n\r\n\r\n Q: But just to be clear, this was produced by government employees, by people here at the White House\u2014this campaign-style video here?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn\u2019t use the word \u201cproduced.\u201d All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s not going to have any impact. But just think of it: You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country.\n\r\n\r\n Some people wish we never closed it down. Now, if we didn\u2019t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people. You know, interestingly\u2014so I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m against that. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: You don\u2019t think you made any mistakes along the way here? You think everything you did was right?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well\u2014well, look, governors should have had ventilators; they chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven\u2019t heard\u2014other than, you know, there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, \u201cWe want ventilators.\u201d They got the ventilators. You don\u2019t have that anymore. And the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, Jon, we\u2019ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2,000 in New York, which you don\u2019t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We\u2019re ready to rock. This was a great\u2014this was a great military\u2014and beyond that\u2014operation.\n\r\n\r\n Let\u2019s get back to the regular. Shouldn\u2019t we get back to the regular? We could talk about this, but all I\u2019m doing is this: I could have given you\u2014like, those are four or five clips that we just played for you. I could have given you hundreds of people\u2014I mean, Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors, singing praises. He says, \u201cLook\u2026\u201d You know, the question was asked in a negative way. He said, \u201cLook, I know what you want to say but\u2014want me to say, but he\u2019s been really good. It\u2019s hard for me to say that. In fact, it\u2019s impossible for me to say it.\u201d Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.\n\r\n\r\n I have many clips from many\u2014I have some clips from Anthony, that I didn\u2019t want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say, when I closed the country to China, when I closed the\u2014the China ban, whatever you want to call it\u2014Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don\u2019t want to put words in Anthony\u2019s mouth, by the way, and I like him.\n\r\n\r\n Today, I walk in and I hear I\u2019m going to fire him. I\u2019m not firing\u2014I think he\u2019s a wonderful guy.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But why did you tweet something that said \u201cFire Fauci\u201d? Why did you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: You retweeted the hashtag #FireFauci.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I retweeted somebody. I don\u2019t know. They said \u201cfire.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Did you notice that when you retweeted it?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I notice everything.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So you retweeted it even though it said, \u201cTime to fire Fauci\u201d?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, no, that\u2019s somebody\u2019s opinion. All that is is an opinion.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But you read it and you elevated it.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, I was called about that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not firing him.\u201d In fact, if you ask your friends in the office\u2014in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that. And I said, \u201cNo, I like him. I think he\u2019s terrific.\u201d Because this was a person\u2019s view. Not everybody is happy with Anthony. Not everybody is happy with everybody.\n\r\n\r\n But I will tell you, we have done a job, the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we\u2019ve done\u2014nobody has ever done a job like this.\n\r\n\r\n We have 50 governors\u2014and territories, by the way. People don\u2019t ever mention that we have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats, and they can\u2019t find anything to complain about. And honestly, many of them didn\u2019t do their jobs. I\u2019ll let you know someday\u2014let\u2019s see what happens\u2014but I may let you know who\u2019s not doing their job. I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. But we help some of the ones that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They should have had their own stockpiles. And now, if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators.\n\r\n\r\n The hardest thing is a ventilator, because it\u2019s expensive, it takes a while to get. We got them, and nobody believed we did.\n\r\n\r\n Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many. And we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said\u2014you said very strongly that they just don\u2019t need that many. You said they don\u2019t need that many beds\u2014Deborah.\n\r\n\r\n So that\u2019s it.&nbsp; Steve, go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: To be clear, you and Dr. Fauci are on the same page?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don\u2019t know what it is exactly. But if I put somebody\u2019s opinion up\u2014you know, I don\u2019t mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing. But I want it to be honest controversy.\n\r\n\r\n Now, when I got a call\u2014I got a call not very quickly; nobody, you know, saw that as being any big deal\u2014they said, \u201cHow are you doing with Dr. Fauci?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m doing great.\u201d And I didn\u2019t talk to Dr. Fauci, even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So he said that once you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Can I\u2014can I ask you? He said the question was hypothetical. But what he was just acknowledging is that lives would have been saved if the mitigation practices were put into place earlier. That seems obvious. Do you not agree with that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s the thing. No, no. What he really is saying though: \u201cBut how could you have done it?\u201d Look, I just went over stats with you. Right here. Right here.\n\r\n\r\n How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America?\u201d \u201cOh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d How many deaths do we have?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n January 17th\u2014go back another week. On January 17th\u2014this is 10 days before I did the\u2014little bit less than 10 days before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe. And a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do, because you look at Spain\u2014and, by the way, we\u2019re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low, and per capita we\u2019re very low. We\u2019re doing very well.\n\r\n\r\n But how do you close up the United States of America? So, on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths. And no\u2014no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I\u2019m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases?\n\r\n\r\n Q: You didn\u2019t close down until the middle of March. \u201cShould you have closed it down earlier?\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the question.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I closed down from China.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It\u2019s not about January.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And, by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them. Okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would have said, \u201cLet\u2019s ride it out.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that.\n\r\n\r\n And I did this last time: Cut it in half. Don\u2019t say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half. Say a million people died\u2014well, that\u2019s much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half; that\u2019s 500,000 people would have died. Now, that number we would have reached. Okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing, and our timing was very good.\n\r\n\r\n But here\u2019s the one thing\u2014and you have to say this\u2014when you ask me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this?\u201d\u2014how come when I did the ban on China and some very, very\u2014instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s all march. This is not going to happen\u201d? How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks\u2014if you call CNN a network; I don\u2019t, personally. But we have CNN, we have many other places, and they\u2019re all saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to do it. He doesn\u2019t need to do it.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n All I\u2019m saying is this: How do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world when, on January 17th, you have no cases and no death; when on January 21st, you have one case and no death? One case. Think of it. Now, we\u2019re supposed to close down the country?\n\r\n\r\n But here\u2019s what happened: When, on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need the ban. You\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t go crazy. Like, he has\u2014he didn\u2019t even know what the hell the ban was. But he\u2014so he didn\u2019t go crazy. But he did say \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Your ban bought you time.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: He did call me xenophobic.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What did you do with that time?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. He called me xenophobic; he called me a racist because\u2014he has since apologized and he said I did the right thing. So when you say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this?\u201d Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives, by doing that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But what did you do with that time that you bought? The argument is that you bought yourself some time and you didn\u2019t use it to prepare hospitals, you didn\u2019t use it to ramp up testing. Right now \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re so\u2014you\u2019re so \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014nearly 20 million people are unemployed.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re so disgraceful. It\u2019s so disgraceful the way you say that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Tens of thousands of Americans are dead.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Let me just\u2014listen.\n\r\n\r\n Q: How is this sizzle reel \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I just went over it.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014or this rant supposed to make people feel confident \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I just went over it.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014in an unprecedented crisis?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Nobody thought we should do it. And when I did it \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: But what did you do with the time that you bought?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You know what we did?\n\r\n\r\n Q: The month of February. That \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You know what we did?\n\r\n\r\n Q: That video has a gap. The entire month of February.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: What do you do\u2014what do you do when you have no case in the whole United States when you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: You had cases in February.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. You reported it: zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th.\n\r\n\r\n Q: January.\n\r\n\r\n Q: January, February\u2014the entire month of February.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: January. I said in January.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Your video has a complete gap: the month of February.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: On January 30th \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: A lot.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: A lot. And, in fact, we\u2019ll give you a list\u2014what we did. In fact, part of it was up there. We did a lot.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It wasn\u2019t in the video. The video had a gap.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Look. Look, you know you\u2019re a fake. You know that. Your whole network\u2014the way you cover it\u2014is fake. And most of you\u2014and not all of you\u2014but the people are wise to you. That\u2019s why you have a lower\u2014a lower approval rating than you\u2019ve ever had before, times probably three.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Twenty million people now are unemployed.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And when you ask me that questions \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Tens of thousands of people are dead, Mr. President.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Let me ask you this: Why didn\u2019t Biden\u2014why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology?\n\r\n\r\n Q: I don\u2019t think the unemployed people right now care about why Joe Biden didn\u2019t apologize to you, sir.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So get us the list of what you did in February.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Now, I could\u2019ve\u2014I could\u2019ve kept it open. And I could\u2019ve done what some countries are doing. They\u2019re getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody has ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would have done that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve done this right. And we really\u2014we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn\u2019t cover it the way it should be.\n\r\n\r\n Go ahead. One more question. Steve, go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: There\u2019s a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopened. What authority do you have?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we\u2019re going to get into that in a minute. We\u2019re going to just finish this up. We\u2019re going to tell you about other things that we\u2019ve done right.\n\r\n\r\n But I will say this: Had we said, \u201cLet\u2019s just keep going and let\u2019s not do a closing\u201d\u2014whether it\u2019s 2.2 that they, at one point, predicted as an outside or 1.6 at a lower number; you cut it all the way down to 6- or 7- or 800,000; take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster.\n\r\n\r\n So, the minimum number was 100,000. And I think\u2014I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the 100,000. And I hope we will.\n\r\n\r\n All right. So, today, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot, by the way\u2014which you didn\u2019t like to talk about\u2014in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received, today, 1,300 additional ventilators. Now, we\u2019re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big, and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We\u2019re ready to\u2014we\u2019re ready to rock.\n\r\n\r\n The contracts are with General Electric, Hillrom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire, combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Philips and two other contracts with Hamilton and ZOLL. We\u2019re adding 6,190 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile, of which we have a lot already\u2014thousands\u2014close to 10,000. But this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May. And more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year.\n\r\n\r\n Now, we\u2019re going to help other countries. We\u2019re going to help states if they need it. We may help some states\u2019 stockpile. You know, they\u2019re supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They\u2019re supposed to be using that. And unfortunately, most of the states weren\u2019t there. And a lot of people didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but they weren\u2019t there. We will talk about it at the right time, if you want to. I\u2014at this point, I\u2019m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic\u2014anything you want to call it. We got to get past it.\n\r\n\r\n No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators. \u201cWe need ventilators.\u201d Because they didn\u2019t have them. Because the states should have had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That\u2019s not even really our responsibility.\n\r\n\r\n Now, if we can help, we\u2019re going to do it. But that\u2019s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we\u2019ve actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe and we really\u2014they rose to this incredible occasion.\n\r\n\r\n I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought, in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the governor, I said, \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t build that second hospital, because we don\u2019t want to build it if you don\u2019t need it.\u201d He called back, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need it.\u201d They had 1,000 rooms, 1,000 beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn\u2019t need the other one so we stopped it because we don\u2019t want to waste.\n\r\n\r\n But we\u2019re prepared to build thousands more should we need it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need it because it looks like we\u2019re plateauing and maybe even, in many cases, coming down.\n\r\n\r\n In addition, we\u2019ve ordered a total of 60 mobile decontamidation [sic]\u2014-contamination systems. So the decontamination system from Battelle, in Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks, and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I\u2019ve been asking from the beginning: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?\u201d And it turned out we can. And there was a great company in Ohio, they sent us some great equipment, and they\u2019re doing that now.\n\r\n\r\n And now we\u2019re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it\u2019ll be great. It\u2019s something that, frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago.\n\r\n\r\n Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge\u2014our massive air lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks, and 4.9 million gowns. So, we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it.\n\r\n\r\n Now, the states\u2014the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff. But should they need it, we are ready to give them, because we\u2019re building up our stockpile again like crazy.\n\r\n\r\n Remember, I\u2014and you saw the stories. I inherited\u2014this administration\u2014Mike, myself, the whole administration, we inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing. And I say it and I\u2019ll say it again: Just like we didn\u2019t have ammunition, we didn\u2019t have medical supplies, we didn\u2019t have ventilators, we didn\u2019t have a lot of things that should have been had. And you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened: They didn\u2019t want to spend the money. But we did.\n\r\n\r\n To date, we\u2019ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week, we\u2019ll be sending 2 million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He\u2019s got great detail on that, and I think it\u2019s a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock, and we have more coming.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients, including at the East Orange, New Jersey Medical Center, as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They\u2019re ready. They\u2019re able. They\u2019re beautiful. Hopefully, we won\u2019t need too many of them because, frankly, we built everything that the governors wanted. And in many cases, it\u2019s too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.\n\r\n\r\n The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus. Three million\u2014the most of any nation. We are performing approximately 150,000 tests every single day and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus, if you look. And that\u2019s really\u2014and it has hit some areas\u2014the virus\u2014very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world.\n\r\n\r\n The NIH, CDC, and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We\u2019re looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting, over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed, as we speak.\n\r\n\r\n In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug, remdesivir, has shown promising results\u2014very promising\u2014in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted emergency use authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient\u2019s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem.\n\r\n\r\n Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that\u2014that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with Zinc\u2014depending on your doctor\u2019s recommendation. And it\u2019s having some very good results, I\u2019ll tell you.\n\r\n\r\n I think if anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it\u2019s a lot of good things that are happening with it. A lot of good tests.\n\r\n\r\n Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick. And this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it\u2019s done in a very modern way.\n\r\n\r\n During this difficult time, we\u2019re also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy.&nbsp; We may be asking for an extension because, obviously, they can\u2019t be doing very much right now. They wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to do it. So, the Census, we\u2019re going to be asking for a delay\u2014a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now?\n\r\n\r\n The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporarily suspend its field operation data-collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension. I don\u2019t know that you even have to ask them. This is called \u201can act of God.\u201d This is called a\u2014a situation that has to be\u2014they have to give in. I think 120 days isn\u2019t nearly enough.\n\r\n\r\n My administration is also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill.\n\r\n\r\n By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion. And from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that\u2019s very much on time and going very nicely. He\u2019ll be speaking in a moment. And payments\u2014these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400. That\u2019s for a family of four. That\u2019s something.\n\r\n\r\n Additionally, through our Paycheck Protection Program \u2013which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks are taking a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it\u2019s going rapidly.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds because it\u2019s really something that has been an incredible success. And they need more money to keep it going to take care of these business and keep them\u2014keep them open.\n\r\n\r\n I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month, and even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. You know, we\u2019ve been working together with a lot of for, it seems like, forever.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts, and we\u2019re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. And that\u2019s so important.\n\r\n\r\n We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration\u2019s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That\u2019s what we want. We want to have our country open. We want to return to normal life. Our country is going to be open, and it\u2019s going to be successfully opened. And we\u2019ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We\u2019re actually calling it a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. And we\u2019ll be announcing them tomorrow.\n\r\n\r\n This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC Plus\u2014that\u2019s OPEC plus additional energy-producing nations\u2014representing many of the world\u2019s largest oil-producing countries to stabilize oil markets. And we have, in fact\u2014and I think you\u2019ve seen a big stabilization over the last couple of days.\n\r\n\r\n Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they\u2019ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. And that will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many of other\u2014other of our big energy states.\n\r\n\r\n This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry. It\u2019s a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the King of Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia\u2014both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine\u2014a man who\u2019s become a friend of mine: The President of Mexico showed great flexibility. President L\u00f3pez Obrador. He showed great flexibility and\u2014and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him. And I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal. Very historic. So we\u2019ll see how it all goes.\n\r\n\r\n In this time and challenge\u2014and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven\u2019t been in many, many decades\u2014we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I\u2019m so proud of the American people.\n\r\n\r\n Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to happen sooner than people think. And we\u2019re going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We\u2019re going to be safe about it. We\u2019re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals.\n\r\n\r\n Together, we\u2019re beating back the invisible enemy and we\u2019re paving the way for great resurgence. Really, a great resurgence for American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They\u2019re going to go back safely, and that\u2019s what we want.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we\u2014before we do this\u2014because I know there\u2019s an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll ask Steve to come up\u2014Secretary of the Treasury. You can talk a little bit and then maybe take a couple of questions about what\u2019s happening. Tell them the success we\u2019re having.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you very much.\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. As you announced, we are very pleased that we are ahead of schedule on delivering the economic impact payments. These are what was known as the checks in the mail that we want to deliver in direct\u2014direct deposit.\n\r\n\r\n This is ahead of schedule. We started processing those last Friday. We expect that over 80 million hardworking Americans will get the direct deposit by this Wednesday. And we know how important that is to all of those hardworking Americans, many of which are at home, not working at the moment.\n\r\n\r\n If you do not receive them by Wednesday\u2014on Wednesday, we will be launching at IRS.gov. Click on IRS.gov, go to \u201cGet Your Payment.\u201d If you filed a tax return in 2018 and \u201919\u2014or \u201919\u2014have that information available. You\u2019ll be able to ID yourself, you\u2019ll be able to put in your direct deposit information, and within several days, we will automatically deposit the money into your account. We want to do as much of this electronically as we can. It\u2019s very important in this day and age. It\u2019s more secure, and you don\u2019t have to go to the bank.\n\r\n\r\n If you\u2019re a Social Security beneficiary, you do not need to do anything. You will get a direct deposit. If you have not filed and did not need to file a 2018 and \u201819 return, you can go to IRS.gov now and enter your information and authenticate yourself. So again, we are very pleased that that is ahead of schedule.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019d also like to announce the progress we\u2019re making on the new SBA program, the PPP. Let me just remind everybody: This is a brand-new program that is now one week old.\n\r\n\r\n We have distributed and confirmed $230 billion of loans to over 4,600 lenders participating. That is multiples and multiples of anything that the SBA has ever done in\u2014in one year, before. And I especially want to thank the broad-based community banks that are participating. Again, over 4,600 banks.\n\r\n\r\n If you haven\u2019t had your loan processed, you will get it processed this week. As the President said, we\u2019ve gone back to Congress and asked them for more money to make sure that every business has access to this.\n\r\n\r\n Let me also comment for the states. We are distributing out half the money, this week, to the states. That\u2019s a week ahead of time. And we\u2019ll deliver the other half of the money to the states next week.\n\r\n\r\n And then let me just finally comment, we\u2019ve been very\u2014working very closely with the Federal Reserve. Last week, we announced expanded facilities and new facilities that total $2.3 trillion of liquidity. And in particular, I\u2019d just like to highlight a Main Street lending facility that will be for companies between one worker and 10,000 people\u2014so mid-sized businesses\u2014and also, a municipal facility for states and local governments to be able to access funds given the shortages that they have.\n\r\n\r\n So with that, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You have any questions for Steve, please?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Secretary Mnuchin, thank you, sir. Both Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have said that they\u2019re in negotiations with you right now on additional funding for these small-business loans, for that package. Leader McConnell, though, has said that nothing should be added to the package. They should just be specific to small-business loans. What is the opinion of your administration? Should there be some sort of horse-trading here or should it just be small business loans?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, the President\u2019s view and the Vice President\u2019s and my view is this was a bipartisan program. This SBA program, it wasn\u2019t a Republican program, it wasn\u2019t a Democrat program; it was a bipartisan program. We\u2019ve committed to small businesses. We should top up that program now. I know the Democrats want to talk about more money for hospitals and states. Right now, we\u2019re just sending the money out to the hospitals and states. They haven\u2019t come close to using that money. And I know the President and Vice Presidents have said once we get the SBA done, we can go into another funding bill.\n\r\n\r\n The President has talked about potentially adding infrastructure and other things. We think there is a likelihood we will need more money, and we will\u2014we will sit down and try to get a bipartisan bill. But this is important we deliver on small businesses. Fifty percent of the people work for small businesses.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, sir.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What\u2019s the emergency that the President said you had to go for? The President said you had an emergency meeting \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Negotiation.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Over this bill?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yeah, well\u2014or because we don\u2019t want to run out of money. We\u2019ve used about $220 billion of the $350 billion. We don\u2019t want to run out of that money. We don\u2019t want to create panics that people won\u2019t get it. So that\u2019s why we want to\u2014we want to top that up, and we\u2019ve asked for another $250 billion for that program.\n\r\n\r\n And again, let me just remind you, every dollar we spend in this program, we save a dollar of unemployment insurance. So even though we\u2019re asking for $250 billion, it really won\u2019t cost that much.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Could I follow up?\n\r\n\r\n Q: What are your\u2014do you have concerns about lifting the guidelines too soon? And what\u2019s the economic impact? I understand the economic argument for getting people back to work, obviously. But what\u2019s the economic risk of lifting them too early and seeing then a spike in cases again?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, of course there\u2019s economic risks in both directions. We reviewed with the President today a very broad list of over 100 business people that are going to help advise the President on what needs to be done to reopen the economy.\n\r\n\r\n We want to make sure\u2014and again, the combination of economic impact payments, small-business payments, enhanced unemployment insurance\u2014the President made very clear, we want to make sure that hardworking Americans have liquidity while we wait to reopen the government.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So do you believe the government should be re-\u2014or that the country, excuse me, should be reopened on May 1?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I\u2019ve had discussions with the President. I know he\u2019s considering it, and I believe he\u2019s going to make a decision later in the week.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We have to do\u2014everything has to be safe. We want safe.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What is your advice to the President?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: My advice is: As soon as it\u2019s ready to open and based upon the medical professionals, and\u2014and again, we\u2019re working very closely with the President and outside business leaders to develop a plan.\n\r\n\r\n Q: I just wonder\u2014I wanted to ask you, Mr. President, what you think\u2014what\u2014if you could sketch for us what reopening the economy looks like. Do you think it\u2019s going to be everything open? Or do you think \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ll be doing that over the next few days because we\u2019ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like.\n\r\n\r\n I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the\u2014the biggest from every business on this council. We\u2019re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. And we have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But, no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we got to get our country open.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah, I understand that, Mr. President. Do you think there is a possibility then that what you do is you open it incrementally? Do you think people will go back to restaurants, to concerts, the cinema?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And let me ask one final \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I think eventually they&nbsp;will do that. And I think we\u2019re going to\u2014boom\u2014I think we\u2019re going to\u2014I think it\u2019s going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there\u2019s a pent-up demand like there hasn\u2019t been in a long time.\n\r\n\r\n And that\u2019s why\u2014and that\u2019s why you see the stock market\u2014I mean, to think that the stock market is at the level it is right now, with all that this world and this country has gone. And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they\u2019ve been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I\u2019ve seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this.\n\r\n\r\n And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much\u2014you know, it was looking a little bleak for a while, but it\u2014it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that\u2019s a great tribute to the fact that there\u2019s a demand.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, thank you, sir. In regards to some of your tweets earlier today, and I think it was Steve\u2019s question, my question to you is: What provision in the Constitution gives the President the power to open or close state economies? And then \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Numerous provisions. We\u2019ll give you a legal brief if you want.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And then\u2014we\u2019ll be looking forward to that, sir. But following up: What happens if you say, for instance, \u201cWe want states to reopen but California or New York do not open\u201d? What would you do then?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess, you know, that could happen, but I don\u2019t think that would happen.\n\r\n\r\n Go ahead please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It\u2019s been states that have closed, ordered schools closed. It\u2019s been states that have ordered businesses like restaurants and bars closed.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s because I let that happen because I would have preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen and I like the way they\u2019ve done it. And the seven that remained really in sort of a semi-lockdown\u2014if you look at those states, they\u2019ve really done a very good job. They\u2019re very much different from a New York or from other places where they\u2019ve been hit very hard.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So you\u2019re prepared then to bigfoot states and say, \u201cI order you to open your schools, I order to force kids to be able to go\u201d?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please. Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yes, Mr. President. Following up on that, there are two consortiums of states today\u2014California, Oregon, and Washington on the West Coast; Northeastern states\u2014totally representing about 100 million people, who have said they\u2019re going to cooperate and decide when to reopen those states.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, they can decide, but \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Does that undermine what you\u2019re trying to do?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, not at all. Let me just tell you\u2014very simple. I\u2019m going to put it very simply: The President of the United States has the authority to do what the President has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The President of the United States calls the shots.\n\r\n\r\n If we weren\u2019t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you\u2019ve never seen before. We were here to back them up. And we\u2019re backing\u2014and we\u2019ve more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It\u2019s a decision for the President of the United States.\n\r\n\r\n Now, with that being said, we\u2019re going to work with the states because it\u2019s very important. You have local governments, they\u2019re pinpointed. It\u2019s really\u2014you talk about\u2014it\u2019s like a microchip. They are pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. And if they don\u2019t do a good job, I\u2019d step in so fast. But no, they can\u2019t do anything without the approval of the President of the United States.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But, Mr. President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So if some states refuse to reopen and you order them to, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution says all powers that don\u2019t reside in the President or Congress reside in the states. How do you overcome that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, if some states refuse to open, I would be\u2014I would like to see that person run for election. They\u2019re going to open. They\u2019re going to all open.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So that\u2019s a valid (inaudible).\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Now, some will be\u2014are in a different situation. You have\u2014I won\u2019t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I\u2019m going to be very specific. But you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard. But all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible. But they want to open safely and so do I.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Today, the French President Emmanuel Macron said that he will keep the shutdown in France until the middle of May. Does that mean that the U.S. will keep the ban from flights from \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard. And again, he has to do what he has to do. He\u2019s a friend of mine. But France\u2014Spain has just been decimated. You look at what\u2019s happened in Italy, it\u2019s a very well-known fact, what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Question for Secretary Mnuchin: Has everybody that you would like to have\u2014the 100 business people on the Economic Council\u2014have they all been invited already? Have they all agreed to be \u2014\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: They ha-\u2014they haven\u2019t been invited yet. We\u2019ve just reviewed the names with the President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a group.\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u2014today, for him to sign off on.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And are they from all sectors? Energy \u2014\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes, there\u2019s\u2014basically, there\u2019s verticals. So every single area of the economy we wanted to be represented.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Great. One other thing. Is there anything else that needs to be done to work on industry\u2014oil industry jobs\u2014to save oil industry jobs after the deal this past weekend?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think there\u2019s always things. So we\u2019re working with Larry Kudlow. I mean, we have \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Anything specifically that needs to be done?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: We have\u2014we have economic plans for every single part of the economy. Obviously, in the case of the oil industry, they\u2019ve been hit especially hard because you\u2019ve had both the supply issue and you\u2019ve had the demand issue.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Have you\u2014have you figured out the bailout money for the airlines, with the allocations for the airlines?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve worked very hard. I think, as you probably have seen, we\u2019ve put out a press release that we have now had discussions with almost all the airlines. I\u2019ve personally had discussions with all the major airlines\u2019 CEOs. We specifically created an exception for small airlines that we could process very quickly. And I think you\u2019ll see, very quickly, decisions coming out. I\u2019m very pleased with the discussions we\u2019ve had.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ve had very good dis-\u2014really just good discussions.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. Secretary?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Do you still see a need for a phase four stimulus? Or is this push to reopen \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Steve, I just want to say we have had \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014the economy in lieu of that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT:\u2014discussions\u2014wait, excuse me. One second, please. We\u2019ve had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And is it possible to reopen the economy on May the 1st?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t want to say that. You\u2019ll be hearing over the next few days.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Is phase four going to be later than that, Mr. President?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN:&nbsp; Let me\u2014let me just comment\u2014I\u2019m going to answer your question.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. Secretary, do you see a need for a phase four? Or is this push in lieu of another stimulus?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Okay. So again, let me just comment\u2014I mean, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, approved an unprecedented amount of money to help American workers and American business because it was no fault of their own that business was closed down. We had been very diligently executing on that. You know, everybody said it was going to take months to get people money. We are executing very quickly. We created a whole new SBA program in a week.\n\r\n\r\n Our job right now is to execute the $2.3 billion, which we can add several trillion dollars with the Fed.\n\r\n\r\n The one area we are particularly concerned about is the Small Business program. Quite frankly, it\u2019s even more incredibly popular and successful than we anticipated. So the President wants to be very clear: We have money for that. And once we get done with that, we will review with the President. If there is more money that needs to be\u2014to support this economy, to support hardworking Americans\u2014we will work with Congress to get that in time.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And, Steve, do you want to talk about phase four?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, phase four, the President has talked about infrastructure for a long period of time. We\u2019ve talked about\u2014to the extent that the hospitals need more money because of the medical issues, we\u2019ll monitor that. We want to make sure there are incentives for restaurants, entertainment\u2014people to get back to those types of things. So we\u2019ll be looking at, very specifically, provisions to stimulate parts of the economy. Some of them may be money issues. Some of them may be regulatory issues.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, just to clarify your understanding of your authority vis-\u00e0-vis governors\u2014just to be very specific: For instance, if a governor issued a stay-at-home order \u2014<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: When you say \u201cmy authority\u201d\u2014the President\u2019s authority. Not mine, because it\u2019s not me.\n\r\n\r\n Q: If I could just ask the question \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: This is\u2014when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It\u2019s total? Your authority is total?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s total. It\u2019s total.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Your authority is total?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And the governors know that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So if a governor \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: The governors know that. No, you have \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: If a governor issues a stay-at-home order, you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT:\u2014a couple of bands of\u2014excuse me. Excuse me. You have a couple \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Could you rescind that? Could you rescind that order?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree to it.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What if it was a Republican governor?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: But the authority of the President of the United States, having to do with the subject we\u2019re talking about, is total.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please, go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, one of the things you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: One of the things you\u2014one of the things you spoke\u2014we saw in your video about was the travel ban from Europe. As part of reopening America, do you want to reopen the borders so that people from Europe, from the UK \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: At the right time.\n\r\n\r\n Q: How soon do you think we are from \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And a very good question, actually.\n\r\n\r\n Well, I\u2019m going to have to take a look. I wouldn\u2019t say Italy is doing great right now, and I wouldn\u2019t say Spain is doing great right now. And we just heard that France is extending its stay-inside order, right? Their stay\u2014they\u2019ve extended it\u2014I just see that\u2014and, I think, for a short period of time.\n\r\n\r\n But no, when they\u2019re back. We want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything is good.\n\r\n\r\n No, right now we have a very \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Weeks, months?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Right now we have a very strong ban. We\u2019re going to keep it that way until they heal.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Weeks, months? What would you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can\u2019t tell you that. I can\u2019t tell you that. I have to see: How are they doing? I mean, France just went for another two days\u2014for another two weeks. We have to see.\n\r\n\r\n Jon.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So Dr. Fauci said that you took his advice on the question of mitigation. He made the recommendation. You accepted it. You put into place. As you make this next decision, which, as you have said \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m not sure who\u2014Jon, I\u2019m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: No, not on the ban. I\u2019m talking about the mitigation.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don\u2019t know.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014the social\u2014the social distancing, I\u2019m talking about. The shutting down.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Okay.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Not of travel, but of activity. So my question is: As you make this next decision, which you have said may be the most difficult or important decision of your presidency, will you assure the American people that you will again take the advice of the doctors\u2014of Dr. Fauci, of Dr. Birx? Will you take the advice of the health experts before you do that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I will and many other people also. But I will absolutely take their advice.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But would you go against them?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Please go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yes, Mr. \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Would you go against their recommendation? If they say you need another 15 or 30 days, would you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think it would be likely because I think we\u2019re not very far from being on the same page.\n\r\n\r\n Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yes, Mr. President, one thing that Governor Cuomo said today is that states do not have the capacity to do the mass COVID-19 testing ahead of a reopening as \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, they have to do it. Look, they\u2019re supposed to be doing it.\n\r\n\r\n Q: He says he can\u2019t purchase the diagnostic tests or equipment \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I know. I know.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014and needs federal help. So will the states get that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2014they may need help, but \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Will they get it?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: But they\u2019re there. They\u2019re on ground. They\u2019ve got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But he needs the supplies.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuilt tests. We\u2014we rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare, as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing.\n\r\n\r\n I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened, where they have such a great test as that?\n\r\n\r\n And, in fact, what I\u2019ll do\u2014I think, unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of the Treasury\u2014do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. Secretary Mnuchin \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Is that for the Secretary of the Treasury or for me?\n\r\n\r\n Q: For Secretary Mnuchin, yeah. Yes, sir.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Because if it\u2019s for me, we can wait.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It\u2019s for Secretary Mnuchin.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We have to get him back to work, okay?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yes, sir. For Secretary Mnuchin, a question \u2014\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014from one of my colleagues who\u2019s not able to be in the room. They\u2019re curious about the SBA rule that prevents small casinos from getting some of this relief. Is that something that you\u2019re taking a look at? Is there going to be a change to the \u2014\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, no\u2014not small casinos, but there are such things as small taverns and restaurants that have literally, you know, small gaming things. And we are coming out with some additional guidance on that. But I want to be clear: It\u2019s not small casinos.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, sir.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Secretary Mnuchin?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Secretary?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: There was a letter that some House Republicans sent this weekend, about the liquidity for a mortgage servicers.\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Are\u2014can you explain what you\u2019re looking at on that front?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Sure. So I think I commented on this a week or so ago. We had a subcommittee task force at FSOC that specifically studied this issue. We have all the appropriate people on it. Ginnie Mae has automatically taken some action. We\u2019ve had conversations with the FHFA as to what they\u2019re going to do for Fannie and Freddie. And we\u2019ve said that to the extent they need certain authorities from the Treasury, we will accommodate that.\n\r\n\r\n So we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re very aware of the issue. Quite frankly, we\u2019ve been studying this issue way before COVID and had concerns about some of these non-bank servicers not being well capitalized. But we\u2019re going to\u2014we\u2019re going to make sure that the market functions properly.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, sir. We have seen, in a number of these relief bills, that Democrats and Republicans have been able to push forward different non-coronavirus-specific funding priorities. Are you trying to keep funding specific to coronavirus? And then, if there are going to be other additions\u2014for instance, a change to labor rules is something that many on the left wanted. Some of the right are wondering if they should also\u2014if you should also be pushing for, you know, their preferred add-ons.\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think our expectation has always been this is COVID related. Some people have a rather broad view of what \u201cCOVID related\u201d is, because it has impacted almost every single business. I mean, I think, we\u2019ve\u2014the President has talked about the Kennedy Center, which is a good institution. Obviously, that was not the major priority in the bill, but they were hit with COVID related.\n\r\n\r\n So\u2014but, no, the President has instructed we want to be very specific in the next bill. It\u2019s COVID-related items.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It\u2019s been reported \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, we didn\u2019t want to do the Kennedy Center, just so you understand. And that that was done\u2014the Democrats wanted it in. We didn\u2019t want that, but they wanted it in. And we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re not looking for extraneous nonsense.\n\r\n\r\n Q: It\u2019s been reported that you argued, at the time the China ban was being discussed, that that was too disruptive to the global economy. Is that accurate?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me be clear: I had nothing to do with the China ban. I wasn\u2019t on the task force at the time. I\u2019m not even sure I was\u2014I think I was traveling at the time. But I never had any\u2014I was not part\u2014I did become very active, and after the China ban, but that report in the New York Times was not accurate.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You did not weigh in beforehand?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I was not part of the task force at that time, and I was\u2014I was not involved. As a matter of fact, I think I may have been traveling.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Secretary Mnuchin, there\u2019s a proposal made by Senator Hawley to get direct payments to employers to pay people who have been laid off and to keep people on payroll. Does the administration support that proposal?\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, again, that is the PPP. The PPP is basically sending money to small business\u201450 percent of American workers\u2014to keep those people paid. And it\u2019s the most efficient way. Every dollar, as I said, we do through that, it\u2019s one less dollar of unemployment. And more importantly, we want those people to have\u2014be associated with the business. So as soon as the President is ready to open up the economy, those businesses are together. We don\u2019t want those businesses to fall apart. That\u2019s why this is such a successful program, and we want Congress to put more money in.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: But are you talking about unemployment? You\u2019re talking about the unemployment?\n\r\n\r\n Q: (Inaudible) Senator Hawley.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Sending it indirectly to the states?&nbsp; We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And, you know, I\u2019ve talked to you about it: We have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems. They\u2019re run by the state. But I\u2019m hearing they\u2019re getting the money out anyway.\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, some\u2014some of them are, and some of the states aren\u2019t, and we encourage\u2014you know, we\u2019re working with the states to try to update their computers, but it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a long haul.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Okay? Thank you, Steve.\n\r\n\r\n SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Phase four, Steve. Phase four. Come on, Steve.\n\r\n\r\n Q: A quick question about something you just said. You said, \u201cWhen someone is President of the United States, their authority is total.\u201d That is not true. Who\u2014who told you that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So you know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to write up papers on this. It\u2019s not going to be necessary, because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately it comes with the federal government. That being said, we\u2019re getting along very well with the governors, and I feel very certain that there won\u2019t be a problem.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Has any governor agreed that you have the authority to decide when their state opens back up?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I haven\u2019t asked anybody because I don\u2019t\u2014you know why?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Because no one has\u2014no one has said that.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Because I don\u2019t have to.\n\r\n\r\n Go ahead, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But who told you the President has the total authority?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Enough. Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You mentioned the Vice President\u2019s call with the governors today. Governor Hogan of Maryland has urged your administration to ask Congress for $500 billion to help stabilize budgetary shortfalls created by coronavirus.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s nice of Governor Hogan, very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan\u2019s statement.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Governor Cuomo said the CARES Act ignored state government shortfalls.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Cuomo.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Do you support that request?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Which one? What did he say?\n\r\n\r\n Q: He said the CARES Act ignored the budgetary shortfalls.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re looking at things in phase four, where they have\u2014you know, where they talk about states, and they\u2019re also talking about hospitals. They\u2019re talking about states who have been battered, and they\u2019re also talking about hospitals. And we\u2019re certainly willing to look at that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Will you urge Congress on their behalf?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You know, we\u2019ll see what we all come back with. But they are talking about states and they\u2019re talking about hospitals.\n\r\n\r\n OAN.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you, Mr. President. The Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has on Thursday signed an executive order banning the sale of non-essential goods. If other states follow \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: The sale of what?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Non-essential goods. She has banned the sale of non-essential goods. Many are calling this draconian, unconstitutional. As President, do you think that if other states were to follow her example in the coming weeks, that the federal government should intervene?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I think it\u2019s very extreme. But she\u2019s doing it, and I think it\u2019s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It\u2019s a very strong position to take. But they\u2019re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let\u2019s see how it all works.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What is the status of the funding for the World Health Organization?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to be talking about that very soon. I\u2019m getting a full report. I\u2019m not happy with the World Health Organization. I\u2019m not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We\u2019ve been ripped off by everybody.\n\r\n\r\n And we have\u2014this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it\u2019s a World Health or World Trade. And they\u2019re like\u2014I call them the \u201cBobbsey Twins.\u201d They\u2019d look at our country\u2014for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We\u2019re doing a lot about it. So we\u2019ll have a report.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019ll also\u2014we\u2019re also talking about the World Trade Organization. But we\u2019ve made a lot of progress there. We\u2019re now winning cases for the first time, because they know I\u2019ll leave if we don\u2019t get treated fairly.\n\r\n\r\n This country\u2014our country\u2014was at a point where we rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization. But now we\u2019re winning a lot of them, because they know I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit, which was very nice.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Do you expect a decision this week on cutting funding for the WHO?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Uh, yeah. I would say, by the end of the week, I\u2019m going to make a decision on that. Yeah. There\u2019s a lot of\u2014right now, there\u2019s a lot of things happening.\n\r\n\r\n Q: On China\u2014why are there no consequences for China, for the misinformation that they shared?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: How do you know there are no consequences?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Because you\u2019ve said. Well, you\u2019ve been asked, and it appear that there were no \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: How do you know there are no consequences?\n\r\n\r\n Q: What are the consequences, Mr. President, for the misinformation \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn\u2019t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?\n\r\n\r\n Q: But people are concerned that they stonewalled, that they gave misinformation \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, you started off by saying, \u201cWhy are there no consequences?\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Q: Because you\u2019ve been asked this a few times, so I\u2019m following up on your response. Why are there no consequences for China?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: How do you know there are no consequences?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Because we\u2019ve asked you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re going to find out.\n\r\n\r\n Q: \u2014and you\u2019ve said\u2014you\u2019ve said that didn\u2019t want to have an consequences because you suggested trade.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn\u2019t tell you. You\u2019d probably be the last person on Earth I\u2019d tell.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So you\u2019re saying there will be consequences?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Uh, yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President\u2014actually, this is a question for Mr. Vice President. Do you agree with the President\u2019s statement and his understanding of federalism, that his power is total\u2014like in the way he described it? Is there anything you\u2019d like to add or any context you\u2019d like to add to the way he was discussing that?\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: I support the President\u2019s leadership under the national emergency declaration that he signed.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019re standing before you today, the first time in American history, when all 50 states have issued emergency declarations, and the territories. This is an unprecedented time in the life of the nation.\n\r\n\r\n And fortunately, as the President has reflected and our health experts will continue to reflect, because the American people have heeded the President\u2019s Coronavirus Guidelines for America; because state governors have taken those and implemented them, even in states where there was not a significant outbreak; and implemented additional measures as we provided them with data about cases and best practices\u2014we\u2019re making real progress as a country.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But it sounds like you think his power is a little bit more circumscribed than totally.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, make no mistake about it: In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. And you can look back through times of war and other national emergencies. And as the President said, we\u2019ll happily brief that.\n\r\n\r\n But in the days ahead, what the President has charged us to do is to work with our health experts. We\u2019re going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to counsel the President. And then, working with the CDC, we\u2019re going to produce new guidelines, based upon the data, for every state and territory in this nation. We\u2019re going to give them guidance. And, as the President has indicated, we\u2019ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we forge with every governor in America.\n\r\n\r\n But this is an unprecedented time. But I have to tell you: When you look at the fact\u2014despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22,000 Americans\u2014when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps that President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America.\n\r\n\r\n I mean, we were discussing today, at the task force, that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today. And that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work. But it\u2019s also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists, now more than a month ago, and our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour.\n\r\n\r\n And I have to tell you that standing here today, I couldn\u2019t be more proud to stand alongside this President and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour.\n\r\n\r\n And I just say to you: To every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you\u2019re saving lives and you\u2019re seeing our nation through this time.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sir, did the states tell you\u2014you\u2019ve been talking to the governors quite a bit\u2014did those coalitions of states on the West Coast and in the Northeast, did they tell you what they are going to be announcing before they announce it?\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Governor Phil Murphy and the governor of Connecticut expressed today that they were going to be speaking on a\u2014and discussing on a regional basis what their recommendations would be. And we assured them today \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Did they alert the White House about that, though, sir?\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: We assured them today on our conference call with, I think, 48 governors that were with us today for the better part of an hour and a half\u2014we told them that what the President would be producing\u2014has directed to be produced are additional guidelines for the states, certified by the CDC, that would inform those governors and local communities and mayors about the best way forward, based on the unique circumstances that those states and those communities are facing.\n\r\n\r\n I think what\u2019s clear is the American people have seen the experience in Washington State, where this really all began for us; and in California; and now, the extraordinary challenges in the Greater New York City area, including New Jersey and Connecticut; the challenges in New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago, parts of Houston.\n\r\n\r\n But they\u2019re also seeing that, in each one of those cases, that the mitigation efforts are truly working. And so we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll work with those\u2014we\u2019ll work with those states. And in some cases, it\u2019ll make perfect sense for them to work together on a regional basis.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Any idea why they didn\u2019t let you know ahead of time what they were planning?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, you don\u2019t know that. You don\u2019t know that.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: But\u2014but the President\u2014the President will be \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: (Inaudible.)\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m sorry.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear your question.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, can you tell us? Did they let you know?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t know that. No, you made a statement. You don\u2019t know that.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t hear your\u2014I didn\u2019t hear your statement. I\u2019m sorry.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And we would\u2014and we would like to have their cooperation. And we are going to have their cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: I\u2014and let me just affirm what the President said. We heard it again today in what I think was our ninth conference call with governors is: I think every American would be proud to see the partnership that this President has forged with governors across the country. I mean, it is an extraordinary statement.\n\r\n\r\n And you\u2019ll see some data when Admiral Polowczyk gets up in just a few moments, but the flow of resources from around the world that we\u2019ve moved into areas that have faced challenges\u2014I mean, this President has directed us to ensure that every state has what they need, when they need it. And the spirit that I heard again from Republicans and Democrat governors today was reflective of that partnership.\n\r\n\r\n And as we move forward to the President\u2019s goal of reopening America, we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: All right, go ahead, with the face mask. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sir, if you can hear me through the mask \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Barely.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Can\u2014can you \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I hear you well, actually.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014the\u2014the District of Columbia argues that they were shortchanged in the most recent funding bill because they were treated as a territory instead of as a state. Will that be made right in phase four?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we\u2019ve done.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: She was on today.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I mean, she\u2019s actually\u2014and she was on today, saying very good things.\n\r\n\r\n Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President, you talked about this being the most difficult decision that you are going to have to take about whether to reopen the economy. I wonder how much it weighs on your mind the thought that if there is a second wave, you\u2019ve reopened the economy and you might have to shut things down again.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: It does. And I hope that won\u2019t happen. I certainly hope that won\u2019t happen, but it does weigh on my mind.\n\r\n\r\n Okay, in the back, go ahead. You had one. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. President?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you. Okay, thank you. A question for one of my colleagues who wasn\u2019t able to be here. China deployed an aircraft carrier into the South China Chi [sic]\u2014South China Sea this weekend, amid claims by Chinese state media that COVID has reduced U.S. military readiness in the region. What kind of responses are you thinking of? Will you have a response to this action?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that\u2014we\u2019re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I\u2019ve been very explicit on that. But we know all about that.\n\r\n\r\n And, no, China is\u2014we\u2019ve seen what they did. We\u2019ve seen many other things that they\u2019ve done, both pro and con. And we\u2019ll be just fine.\n\r\n\r\n Q: On Abbott, you said something earlier, where you said that you\u2019re putting together the economic task force and that you thought that the recommendations were happening earlier than expected. Did you mean to suggest that it could be before May 1st that you start recommending that states open?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t want to say that, but we\u2019re going to be putting out guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly. In a few days.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You\u2019re not ruling out that it would be before?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not going to say. But, look, certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They\u2019re doing, really, very well. And so we\u2019re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon.\n\r\n\r\n Steve?\n\r\n\r\n Q: And would these new guidelines be\u2014would they fit each area or would they be a uniform set of guidelines?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, you\u2019re going to see. I\u2014I don\u2019t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know, pretty much\u2014we have some good ideas.\n\r\n\r\n I also do want to get\u2014I want to have\u2014we\u2019ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people, having to do with certain fields, whether it\u2019s energy or whether it\u2019s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera.\n\r\n\r\n We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do. Whether it\u2019s deductibility or not, we\u2019ll see, but it should be deductibility. You\u2019ll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductibility. The restaurant business, it\u2014it was one of the hot businesses. And then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago. But we may need that to get people back into the restaurants.\n\r\n\r\n Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah. Michelle Obama, today, got behind mail-in voting nationwide as a possible solution to the\u2014on states. She said it shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. Have your advisors told you that that could save lives? And (inaudible)?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Absentee ballot, are you talking about? Absentee ballot?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah, and on a massive scale because of the coronavirus.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know what she did. I mean, I didn\u2019t see that. When did that happen? Today?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah, she\u2019s part of\u2014that\u2019s a nonpartisan group.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I wish her luck. I wish her a lot of luck.\n\r\n\r\n Please, go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: On Abbott Labs, you said you had long \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yes, Mr. President. There\u2019s a little bit of confusion about your phone calls yesterday with President Putin. The Kremlin is saying that you discussed current issues of ensuring strategic security. That wasn\u2019t referred to in the White House<br />\r\nreadout. Can you enlighten us \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: We discussed many things. We did discuss China. We discussed many different things, but we\u2014it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine. And they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels. I think the number is going to be closer to 20\u2014maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10. And I think it was a very important call.\n\r\n\r\n I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia and that was a very important call. And the bottom nine is OPEC Plus. It\u2019s called OPEC Plus because there are other states also, other nations. We came to a very good agreement.\n\r\n\r\n Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: You have \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What was the part about strategic security? Was that \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I would say mostly we were talking about China. We were talking about their borders. And we\u2019re talking about our borders a little bit\u2014our borders with Mexico. Because, as you know, Mexico is a big part of the deal. And Mexico really\u2014it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico. It was not an easy deal for Mexico. And the President\u2014we appreciated a certain amount of flexibility. But we talked about borders, we talked about China, we talked about Mexico.\n\r\n\r\n Q: But \u201cstrategic security\u201d sounds more like arms treaties.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I mean, I\u2014we did talk about the arms. Yes, we did. That was a very important part of the call actually. Yeah, good point.\n\r\n\r\n Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So, on Abbott Labs, you said testing is going great. We know that they have\u2014these machines have been sent to some of the governors, but some of them are saying they don\u2019t have the materials to actually conduct the tests.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, they have to get the material. You know, the governors have to get the material.\n\r\n\r\n Q: The cartridges.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Now, if they can\u2019t get it, they\u2019re going to see us.\n\r\n\r\n Q: The government is\u2014the federal government is distributing those cartridges.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m talking about the local governments. I\u2019m talking about governors have to get the material. Now, they have machines. In fact, we\u2014we\u2019re going to go into\u2014I\u2019d ask Mike to go into it as soon as I leave. They have very powerful machines that they don\u2019t know they even have. I\u2019m not talking about Abbott; I\u2019m talking about the governors. They have machines that are used for this \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: The hospital labs.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You know what I\u2019m talk-\u2014do you know what I\u2019m referring to?\n\r\n\r\n Q: Yeah, they have the two different machines.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Very big, very powerful machines where, in a certain state\u2019s case, they\u2019re only using 10 percent of their capacity and they didn\u2019t know it. That happens to be Illinois.\n\r\n\r\n Jon, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Okay, well, real quick. Real quick. These 15-minute tests that you\u2019ve sent out, these new ones that you had in the Rose Garden, they say\u2014including Governor Sununu in New Hampshire\u2014that they don\u2019t have the cartridges to actually conduct the test. So when will they get those cartridges?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: What do you think the answer to that is?\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re rapidly\u2014we\u2019re rapidly increasing the numbers, Mr. President.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Rapidly increasing the numbers.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: And Deb will speak to (inaudible).\n\r\n\r\n Q: Can we look into when?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Rapidly increases. Well, pretty quickly.\n\r\n\r\n Q: They can\u2014they can do 50,000 a day, right?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have other machines where they can really work.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Can they go up beyond that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And a lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot. They didn\u2019t even know they had them. They didn\u2019t even know that they had them. And Mike is going to be talking about that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And you remember you mentioned, several weeks ago, the\u2014that Google was putting together that website<br />\r\nwhere they would handle the drive-through testing?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Google and Apple.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Have you\u2014have you given up on \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: You mean Google and Apple combination.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Have you\u2014have you moved past that, because you said \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No. A lot of people don\u2019t like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights. I mean, a lot of people don\u2019t like it and some people think it\u2019s great. No, they are working on that, as I understand.\n\r\n\r\n Q: How about the testing website? Remember you said a website for Google and \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, no, I know that. I know that. I know.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And it\u2019s only operating in, I think, five counties in California right now. Is that \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s right. No, Google is looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple or looking at something. We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we\u2019re looking at now is going to be obsolete. That\u2019s how good it is.\n\r\n\r\n We have things happening that are unbelievable. I saw a presentation today that I can\u2019t talk about yet, but it\u2019s incredible. Plus, I think they\u2019re doing\u2014Tony\u2014I think they\u2019re doing very well in the vaccines. They\u2019re working hard on the vaccines and I think you\u2019ll have an answer for vaccines. I believe that there\u2019s some great things coming out with respect to that. Now you need a testing period, but you\u2019re going to have some great things.\n\r\n\r\n Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sir, on the contact tracing that Google and Apple are doing\u2014so a different subject, on the contact \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, no. This is\u2014this is the Google and Apple. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a partnership or what, but they\u2019re working on some \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Correct. So there was the one \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re working on more than one element. They\u2019re working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple. Google is also working on something, as you know, having to do with testing. I believe they\u2019re doing that in a singular fashion.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So my question is not about the drive-through testing website. Not that.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Okay.\n\r\n\r\n Q: On Google and Apple\u2019s contact tracing that they want to \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014they\u2019ve got this process now where they can put, you know, contact tracing on your phone.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I know.\n\r\n\r\n Q: If you opt in, you can be alerted if you\u2019ve been \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s right.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014in contact with someone with the coronavirus. Do you\u2014how do you feel about that?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it. You know that. It\u2019s an amazing thing and it would be\u2014actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar but not as good.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Which other countries are thinking about something similar?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: I hear Singapore is. Singapore is. No, Singapore had a little bit of a setback because they had a \u2013they had a break. You know that, and\u2014but they\u2019ll take care of it. I know\u2014I know the folks in Singapore. They\u2019re doing a great job and they\u2019re going to put it back very quickly. But Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Would you prefer that Americans use some other system?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t want to get into that because we have a whole constitutional thing. We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: A testing question, maybe for Dr. Fauci as well. Can you talk about where the antibody test is and how quickly that will be (inaudible)?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s moving along. I think I can speak because I\u2014I have to leave. Moving along quickly, moving along well. It\u2019s a test that\u2019s been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it. But that\u2019s moving on. The antibody test have\u2014moving along very well.\n\r\n\r\n Okay, anymore COVID-19? COVID-19?\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, Steve.\n\r\n\r\n Q: One soldier on the Theodore Roosevelt has died. Has\u2014have you determined the status of Captain Crozier, the former commander?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s going through the Navy, as I understand it. The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that. And they had a break in\u2014I don\u2019t think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic, to be honest with you. You know, I don\u2019t think the captain should have been writing letters. He\u2019s not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn\u2019t have been writing letters.\n\r\n\r\n And I don\u2019t think\u2014I don\u2019t know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam. But they stopped in Vietnam and all of a sudden they get on, and now you have over 500 sailors and\u2014and people on the ship that are affected. I don\u2019t know whose idea that was, but that wasn\u2019t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic.\n\r\n\r\n Yes, please. Jon. Go ahead, Jon.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Just one last\u2014on this question of constitutionality, I\u2019m just wondering what changed your view because \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Nothing changed it. No, no, I know exactly what you\u2019re going to say. Nothing changed it. The fact that I want to rely on states or maybe will or maybe have, and the fact that we\u2019ve gotten on\u2014that\u2019s one thing. The fact that I don\u2019t want to use the power is another thing. Look \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: But you said from the standpoint of the Constitution \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Constitution.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014you thought it should be up to the governors.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Constitutionally. You can look at constitutionally. You can look at federalism. You can look at it any different way. Jon, the fact that I don\u2019t want to exert my power is much different. We have the power.\n\r\n\r\n You asked, \u201cDoes the federal government have the power?\u201d The federal government has absolute power. It has the power. As to whether or not I\u2019ll use that power, we\u2019ll see. I would rather \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: So if New York wants to stay closed down, you can \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Jon, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government. That\u2019s why with\u2014I guess it\u2019s now seven states not eight that\u2014because South Carolina did\u2014you know, they went away from what we discussed the last time. So that\u2019s why I looked at the individual states; they\u2019re doing a very good job. They\u2019re really doing a very good job. I\u2019d rather have them make the decision.\n\r\n\r\n Now, the fact that I\u2019d rather have\u2014that\u2019s fine. But I have the absolute right to do if I want to. I may not want to. We have a very good relationship. Now, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\r\n\r\n If you notice, the few states you\u2019re talking about, they\u2019re all with Democrat governors. But if governors are doing a good job and they control it better\u2014because you don\u2019t have somebody in Washington saying, \u201cSet up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.\u201d And we\u2019re in Washington and they\u2019re in a state that\u2019s very far away. That\u2019s really\u2014it should be and it should have always been. And I\u2019ve always said it was.\n\r\n\r\n But the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good. And we\u2019ll be announcing, over the next very short period of time, exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing.\n\r\n\r\n Okay, a couple of more. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: On coronavirus and Joe Biden: He\u2019s the presumptive Democratic nominee. Do you have any plans yet on when you\u2019ll start sharing, or when the White House will start sharing some of that information about the coronavirus? Your presidential daily brief?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, nobody has called about coronavirus, about\u2014from their standpoint. Look, they had the H1N1, which is swine flu, and that was a big failure. That was a tremendous failure. They had a lot of failures. And you take a look at what\u2014you take a look at the history. And, you know, 17,000 people died. And you talk about late? They were so late\u2014they were late like it never even existed. That was a\u2014that was a big problem. Caused a lot of other people a big problem too.\n\r\n\r\n So, you know, if Joe Biden would like a briefing, I\u2019d certainly get him a briefing. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do with it.\n\r\n\r\n Yeah, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So, are Jared and Ivanka on\u2014serving on the new task force? And how are you going to balance \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No.\n\r\n\r\n Q: What?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No, they\u2019re not. No.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Okay.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yes, go ahead, please.\n\r\n\r\n Q: I just want to clarify. So, in earlier conversation, there was a description of multiple different councils or tasks\u2014task forces. Can you just explain exactly what the structure is and who is going to be on it?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have Mike\u2019s task force, which is the White House Task Force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say. Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through. And I was on many of those calls. And every call got better and better and better. It was hostile at the beginning. By the time we finished\u2014I mean, today\u2019s call was a very good call, a very friendly call. I think everyone is online.\n\r\n\r\n And again, you don\u2019t have anybody driving you crazy, saying they\u2019re not getting ventilators, they\u2019re not getting all of the different things, they need more beds. They have a lot of beds right now.\n\r\n\r\n Q: (Inaudible) hospitals who\u2014doctors who say they don\u2019t have the supplies that they need.\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And we always err\u2014and I think it\u2019s important for you know\u2014we always erred on the sake of \u201cGive them more.\u201d Even when we didn\u2019t think\u2014we didn\u2019t think New York needed the beds that they were asking for. We didn\u2019t think they needed the ventilators that they asked for. And we were right.\n\r\n\r\n Now, on ventilators, we\u2019re ready to march. I told you this: We\u2019re ready to march. We have 10,000 ventilators. We\u2019re ready to move them anywhere in the country when we need them, if we need them. We\u2019re also building a lot of ventilators, and that\u2019s going to be used at some point, I believe. You know we\u2019re going to have stockpiles, including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us. But we\u2019re also going to help other countries, whether it\u2019s Italy, or Spain, or other\u2014France is having a big problem. They all desperately need\u2014Germany too\u2014they need ventilators.\n\r\n\r\n So we\u2019re going to have a lot of ventilators. We have a lot\u2014you heard the numbers\u2014we have a lot coming next week. Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming.\n\r\n\r\n Okay, final question. Steve.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And on the task force\u2014I\u2019d asked for the task\u2014how the task force is going to be structured. Is it one \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: No. Then we have\u2014in addition to that, we have a number of committees. We\u2019ll have a transportation committee. We\u2019re going to have a manufacturing committee. You\u2019ll see it tomorrow.\n\r\n\r\n We\u2019re also having a religious leaders committee. We have a great group of religious leaders. We\u2019re having committees with religious leaders. You\u2019ve been seeing what\u2019s going on with the churches, and all of that. And we\u2019re going to have a faith leaders committee.\n\r\n\r\n And so we have\u2014we\u2019re going to have a few committees. I\u2019ll call them \u201ccommittees,\u201d and then ultimately we\u2019re going to make decisions. So we\u2019re going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they\u2019re going to be the correct decision. I hope so.\n\r\n\r\n Steve.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So you form the economic task force tomorrow. When do you want them to have recommendations for you?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Soon. Soon. And they already know what I want.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Next week or \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: And so, when we form\u2014when you say \u201cform,\u201d I don\u2019t have to give them instructions. These are very sophisticated people. These are the best people in their fields. So I don\u2019t have to say, \u201cGee, let\u2019s\u2014we just met and we\u2019re going to meet in two weeks and here\u2019s what we\u2019re\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cHere\u2019s what I want.\u201d We\u2019ve already told them. And they\u2019re the \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: What did you tell them you want?\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT:\u2014the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions. I mean, they\u2019re\u2014these are the greatest names. The people that, I think, probably know the best.\n\r\n\r\n So, we\u2019ve called them and we\u2019re going to be speaking to them very soon. And we want them to have\u2014if it\u2019s questions, or statements, we want them to have that for us. And we will have either a response, or maybe\u2014I mean, ideally we\u2019re going to be learning from them. And we\u2019ll be able to do that and put them\u2014put everything we learned from those calls into our new guidelines.\n\r\n\r\n So we\u2019re going to have new guidelines coming soon. I think it\u2019s going to be very good. I think it\u2019s going to be very smooth. And I hope it\u2019s going to be very safe.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Any thoughts on Stanley Chera, sir? Any thoughts on Stanley Chera \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE PRESIDENT: Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time. He\u2019s a great real estate person\u2014passed away. Was a great real estate person. Great. Great. Sort of a legend in New York real estate.\n\r\n\r\n He called me a couple of weeks ago, said he tested positive. Stanley is in his early- to mid-80s, I guess. And Stanley went to the hospital and he never came out. He went into a coma. He was unconscious for a long period of time and he never made it. A great man. He left\u2014very charitable, really a great philanthropist. A very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business. So I got to know him a lot.\n\r\n\r\n He was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States. He was like\u2014like a young boy. And he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy. He was so excited. He thought we\u2019d do such a good job and he was so happy. And he\u2014he was very proud of what we\u2019ve done in this administration.\n\r\n\r\n But he was tested positive, and unfortunately he\u2014he didn\u2019t make it. It\u2019s a very\u2014to me, it\u2019s a very sad thing.\n\r\n\r\n Thank you all very much. Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. As the President mentioned, the task force today spoke to 48 of the nation\u2019s governors. On that call, we reflected on the fact that all\u2014all 50 states had emergency declarations in place, which was a first for American history; $5.2 billion had been distributed to the states under the Stafford Act. And it was a productive call and reflective of President Trump\u2019s ongoing direction for us to work closely with the states to make sure the states in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus have what they need, when they need it.\n\r\n\r\n We spoke about the issue of testing and supplies. And I\u2019m going to ask Dr. Deborah Birx to come forward, as well as Admiral Polowczyk, to reflect on both of those topics for you. Dr. Birx has been leading an effort from the task force from early on, on rapidly expanding testing.\n\r\n\r\n It was early on that the President formed that public-private partnership with commercial labs. And as we stand here today, more than 2.5 million tests have been performed. And when we add in the estimates of labs that we have to assume, with reasonable protections\u2014projections have not yet reported into the CDC, we think that number could be closer to 3 million tests that have been performed.\n\r\n\r\n As has been mentioned, the new 15-minute test, we are\u2014we are working closely with Abbott Laboratories\u2014that the President and our team met with today here at the White House\u2014to rapidly increase the availability of cartridges. Abbott is producing roughly 50,000 cartridges a day. FEMA acquired an initial supply of that and distributed those to the states, but we\u2019re working with the states to not only distribute what\u2019s being made, but also work with other suppliers to create additional cartridges.\n\r\n\r\n A point that I\u2019ll ask Dr. Birx to expand on in just a moment is the fact that\u2014beyond the new 15-minute test by Abbott Laboratories; beyond what we expect to be a new antibody test, which may well be approved by the FDA in just a matter of days; and an antibody test that would be produced at the rate of 20 million tests a month\u2014the reality is that those commercial laboratories that the President brought in here, the better part of two months ago, and initiated that public- and private-partnership with have been producing hundreds of thousands of tests every single week.\n\r\n\r\n But as Dr. Birx and our team have apprehended, we believe, at this point in time, that of the Roche equipment that is out there that does the high-speed testing\u2014and we informed governors of this today\u2014we think that that some 20 percent of that capacity is not being used.\n\r\n\r\n And with regard to the Abbott m2000 systems, we told the governors today that we think 75 percent of that laboratory capacity that exists in the United States today is not being utilized by our governors. So we sent a very clear message to governors today to reach out to their hospitals, reach out to their labs to identify the presence of the Roche Amplicor 500 and the Abbott m2000 to get those activated.\n\r\n\r\n We literally estimate that, although we\u2019re doing over 110,000 tests a day in the United States, that if our\u2014if our governors and state labs would simply activate the machines that are already there, we could double the amount of testing in the United States literally overnight. And so, I know that governors\u2019 teams watch these briefings, and we\u2019ll remind them very respectfully again to identify those labs. And we have a\u2014we have a team that now is deploying, reaching out to labs to see if we can activate all of those labs.\n\r\n\r\n Secondly, on the subject of supplies\u2014I\u2019ve said it a couple of times from this podium today, but let me say it one more time: President Trump\u2019s direction to us, in dealing with the states on personal protective equipment and ventilators, has been to make sure that states have what they need, when they need it. And we recognize that while we all watch the overall curve of the coronavirus in America\u2014understandably, the national numbers\u2014the reality is this outbreak has taken place in its own individual curves: first, on the West Coast; then the New York City area; then Louisiana, Michigan; and now we continue to contend with it in Chicago and Houston and other metropolitan areas. It has given us the opportunity to ensure that personal protective equipment and ventilators are made available on a critical basis.\n\r\n\r\n And I have to tell you: We\u2019re incredibly proud of the effort and the partnership with states that has us standing here today that no one who has required a ventilator has been denied a ventilator in the United States of America.\n\r\n\r\n At this point, we have just short of 7,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile. But as\u2014as Admiral Polowczyk will detail, we\u2019re already beginning to receive newly manufactured ventilators. We\u2019ll get another thousand in this week. By the middle of May, we\u2019ll literally have another 8,000 ventilators available for deployment around the country.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019m going to let him describe to you the specific detailing of those resources. But\u2014but I want to\u2014I want to share these numbers, most especially for our healthcare workers around the country in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus, so that you know the resources are surging into the hospital systems at the point of the need, and we will continue to do just that.\n\r\n\r\n So let me recognize Dr. Birx to reflect on the data and also on, maybe, some comments on testing. And then Admiral Polowczyk, if you can step up and then you\u2019ll describe the supplies. We\u2019ll hear from Dr. Fauci again, and then take a few questions.\n\r\n\r\n DR. BIRX: Great. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I don\u2019t know if we can get the first slide on cumulative cases? Yes, thank you so much.\n\r\n\r\n I wanted to show you a different way of looking at it today. Obviously, we look at case counts per 100,000 Americans in each of our states and metro areas, but I wanted you to see, in absolute numbers, how much the New York, New Jersey metro area dwarfs all other metro areas.\n\r\n\r\n And so you can\u2019t even see Chicago, Detroit, or Boston. All of those metro areas are under 25,000 cases. You can see that the New York, New Jersey metro area is about almost 250,000 when you bring those cases together\u2014almost a log more. And that\u2019s why you hear us talking a lot about the metro area of New York and New Jersey; and the counties of Rockland and Westchester and Suffolk and Nassau and Bergen, New Jersey; and why we\u2019re so focused on getting resources to that metro area.\n\r\n\r\n If I could see the next slide, then. So if I take New York and New Jersey metro area out, this is the other metro areas that we have been tracking very closely. I wanted to show this to you so that you could see how those curves are already starting to plateau.\n\r\n\r\n So, if you look at Detroit, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Louisiana\u2014Louisiana is in green. Detroit is in gray. You can see across the board, across these metro areas\u2014across metro areas with\u2014have a higher concentration of individuals, this is what the American people in these large cities have done, where it is more difficult often to socially distance. And we\u2019re just really impressed by the work of the mayors and the governors to make this happen.\n\r\n\r\n I also wanted you to see this because you can clearly see Chicago and Boston. And so, Chicago is in the orange and Boston is in the yellow. They are crossing Detroit. And that\u2019s why we have been very much focused on the needs of those areas. And there is one\u2014and Providence is also in that category. It\u2019s difficult for them to\u2014for you to see you them because they\u2019re much further down on the slide.\n\r\n\r\n But the highest\u2014if you look at the axis on this slide\u2014it\u2019s 25,000. The axis on the last slide was 300,000. And so that\u2019s why I really want people to understand each of these epidemics, minor\u2014these small epidemics in each of the metro areas\u2014we\u2019re tracking independently, as well as any epidemics and outbreaks that are happening in some of our other states.\n\r\n\r\n So I just wanted you to have that perspective of how significant the New York, New Jersey issue is and why we\u2019ve been tracking that so closely. But I also wanted to assure all of the other states that we\u2019re tracking them also very closely and really working with the governors and mayors and across\u2014and that\u2019s why I wanted you to see that not only are the curves flattening in some of those major metropolitan areas, but they\u2019re starting to decrease. And this is what we\u2019re very excited about. These are cases. We also know that mortality will lag. And so we\u2019re really tracking also the number of individuals who have succumbed to the COVID-19.\n\r\n\r\n I also wanted to really note here that, yes, our mortality is less when you combine European countries equal to the size of the United States. And I think this is really two things: One, it\u2019s the incredible work of the American people, that it\u2019s also the incredible work of our healthcare providers, and the system of each of these hospitals that have the resources and the ability to respond to the needs of the COVID-19 patients. And I think you can really see the superb healthcare delivery that is happening by the low mortality.\n\r\n\r\n Just to mention really quickly about testing\u2014because you\u2019ve heard me before talk about it, and then it was a little bit misquoted and misaligned\u2014but there are multiple Abbott machines, so I\u2019m going to be very clear, having spent years in the laboratory. The high-throughput machines, which are the Roche 6800 and the 88-\u2014I think it\u2019s the 8800 on Roche\u2014and the Abbott M2000\u2014these are the machines that run between 500 and 1,000 assays at a time.\n\r\n\r\n The Abbott company worked really hard, three weeks ago, in getting a million tests out there to be utilized. And they can make a million tests a week for all of our laboratories that have these platforms. And, so far, to date, somewhere around 250,000 tests have been utilized in three weeks\u2019 worth of work. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been appealing to the\u2014to the laboratory directors to really bring all those machines on.\n\r\n\r\n Last week, Dr. Fauci and his incredible team of researchers have agreed to really reach out and find additional Roche and Abbott high-throughput machines that are in research institutions and doing critical research work, to bring them online also to supplement the other laboratories\u2019 work, to create a mosaic and a complete strategy that brings together the high-throughput platforms, with the medium-throughput platforms, with what are the low-throughput but rapid platforms\u2014which is this ID NOW.\n\r\n\r\n ID NOW is not going to be the answer to the number of tests that we need over the next few weeks. Those run a test every 15 minutes, and we can get about 55,000 cartridges a day.\n\r\n\r\n But I just got done saying that these other machines\u2014of which we have hundreds of\u2014can run 500 to 1,000 in a single timeframe. And so we need to bring all of these assays together. And a team has been created to call every single laboratory and every single research institution across the United States to define the complete capacity in every single state. Because it shouldn\u2019t be our expectation that every governor understands exactly everything that\u2019s in his state, but we have to understand everything in every state in order to be able to meet the needs of the American people as we increase testing.\n\r\n\r\n Now, I know you all know that, in three weeks, we went from 300,000 tests total to 3 million tests total, in three weeks. We know that we have to further increase that. That has been done really by HHS and Admiral Giroir and the team up there. And we\u2019re going to supplement that team to really bring on all of the additional resources and platforms that we have in the United States of America, just like we did with ventilators to bring all of the capacity to bear so that we can also continue to increase testing.\n\r\n\r\n Also, of course as these epidemics are si-\u2014decrease, you can also be able to use more and more testing for surveillance. But I do want to call out the 19 states that aren\u2019t ever represented in these graphics in\u2014by and large. The states have been continuing to do containment and outbreak investigation.\n\r\n\r\n And I\u2019ve been able to talk to many of those states. And I just remind all of us, when I talked to each one of these state health officials, where they are finding outbreaks are in nursing homes. And so we really knew to\u2014need to continue to protect and we continue to test in nursing homes, because we know that that\u2019s a particularly vulnerable group and it\u2019s a group we\u2019re often\u2014now that we\u2019re beginning to understand asymptomatic transmission.\n\r\n\r\n No one is intending to pass the virus on to others, but we know, in essential workers around the United States, people are unknowingly infected and then passing the virus on. And so those are the ones that were very interested in finding. And you might say, \u201cWell, how do you find them because they don\u2019t have symptoms?\u201d And so this is where we really have to increase surveillance in a very deliberative and understand way.\n\r\n\r\n And so we\u2019re really looking what are sentinel surveillance sites. I think we can see where there\u2019s outbreaks, because once people have symptoms, you can see them. But where do you do sentinel surveillance so that you find them before they have symptoms. This is what we have done for decades in HIV, and it\u2019s what\u2019s allowing us right now to really control the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, because we\u2019re finding people when they\u2019re asymptomatic and treating them when they\u2019re asymptomatic. So this is something we know how to do and it\u2019s something we\u2019re working very closely with CDC and others on to make sure that we can bring that full capacity to the American people.\n\r\n\r\n So these are just some insights and what we\u2019re working on. We\u2019re continuing, obviously, to track every single county and community.\n\r\n\r\n And then, finally, I\u2019m going to call on one additional group. There\u2019s a group out there of our HIV/AIDS activists and community workers that understand these tests that I\u2019ve been talking about, these DNA\u2014these RNA-based tests. Because they often get viral loads in HIV. But they will know how to explain this to the community, about sampling and what it means to run those assays. They are essentially virologists. They understand all of these assays. They also understand the antibody assays, because it\u2019s the antibody assays that they counsel and utilize in HIV testing across the United States.\n\r\n\r\n And maybe it will be our translator to the American public and to their local mayors. They understand these tests. They\u2019re\u2014essentially understand all the virology and all the immunology. And I\u2019m really asking all of them to help us communicate what these tests are so the community is ready for them. Because antibody tests measure something very different than the viral load in the front of your nose that we\u2019re using for diagnosis. And so, really being able to understand all of those tests, when to use them, how to use them will be really critical. But the great thing is, in the United States of America, we have these community groups that understand these tests very well, and we\u2019ll be able to discuss them at every level with their community.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m going to call Admiral Polowczyk up in a minute, but I have to call on Dr. Tony Fauci.\n\r\n\r\n Let me\u2014let me\u2014let me just say something really straight from my heart, if I can. I lost my dad 32 years ago today. April 13th is always a tough day for our family. And this morning, when my brothers and sisters were sending around pictures of dad, like we always do, I just thought of the families of the more than 22,000 Americans that we\u2019ve lost.\n\r\n\r\n And I just want to tell you that you\u2019re on our hearts, and you\u2019re in the prayers of millions of Americans as you\u2014as you deal with this heartbreaking loss, as well as families that have family members that are struggling with serious illness.\n\r\n\r\n But let me just encourage everyone that, in the midst of that loss, because the American people have been putting these mitigation measures into practice, there are families that are still together today. And I just want to encourage you here at roughly the halfway point of \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread,\u201d to take\u2014take that to heart. In no way minimize the losses that we\u2019ve experienced as a nation and as families, but\u2014but to be encouraged to know, when you see those numbers on the vast majority of states, that because of what the American people are doing, it\u2019s working.\n\r\n\r\n And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, and the entire team, continually asked us to remind the American people, and we do so again today: Keep doing what you\u2019re doing with the \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread,\u201d and we will hasten the day that we heal our land.\n\r\n\r\n Dr. Fauci?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: I just want to make one comment that related to a question that was asked, and then we\u2019ll have questions. I don\u2019t want to take too much time. The idea about how we would evaluate, from a purely public health standpoint, about what I call reentry into some sort of normality. As health people, I don\u2019t know anything about, nor do I ever claim to know anything about, economics. There are going to be people that know a lot more than I do, who are going to give advice about all of the committees that the President was talking about.\n\r\n\r\n But the one thing we do know as health people, as physicians and scientists and public health people\u2014as I mentioned, I think over the weekend, on one of the shows, is that some people may think it\u2019s going to be like a light switch, on and off. You know, we\u2019re either out and we\u2019re in. It\u2019s just not going to be that way because we have a very large country and there are different impacts. As you see, New York is very different from other parts of the country, from the Midwest, from the mountain region, California and Washington, different than New Orleans.\n\r\n\r\n So as we discuss and consider the public health aspects, it likely would be something that I refer to as sort of like a rolling reentry. It\u2019s not going to be one size fits all. So I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be yet because we still have time to look at it.\n\r\n\r\n Dr. Birx, who does an amazing job with showing you the data and the charts\u2014that\u2019s going to likely influence some of the recommendations that we will make. But I can assure you there will be recommendations that will be based purely on public health. And the President will get a lot of other input from others, but we\u2019ll give the honest, public health recommendation.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tony. Admiral? Admiral Polowczyk will give an update on supplies and then we\u2019ll take a few questions.\n\r\n\r\n REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Can I have the ventilator slide back up? I\u2019ll just start from there. All right, thank you.\n\r\n\r\n So you start with what\u2019s in the stockpile this morning. And then here\u2019s the contracts that we\u2019ll be delivering over the next few weeks. And we added 8,600 ventilators to the pool we already had. That\u2019s the\u2014that\u2019s the math that you\u2014that you get there. That\u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s included the DPA action with GM.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019ll say that we\u2019ve also issued what would be called \u201crated orders\u201d with all of these vendors to allow them front-of-the-line privileges, so to speak, with\u2014within their supply chain. So these\u2014there\u2019s\u2014we\u2019ve, you know, written the contract. This is the 100,000-plus ventilators we\u2019re talking about, and then continue to work with them to ensure that the ventilators actually show up. So there\u2019s a continue to work there. And as we did that, we realized that downstream supply chains needed some additional Defense Production Act work as well.\n\r\n\r\n If you go out to the air bridge\u201480 flights scheduled, 37 complete, 43 on the\u2014on the horizon. And you can see the numbers of material that\u2019s been brought in to supplement the volume that\u2019s needed.\n\r\n\r\n Now, I\u2019m going to go through a series of slides of New York first. So, Dr. Birx provides me what I will call as a geographic reference to align the supply chain. So all of those cities\u2014you\u2019ll see a little bit of a theme here. I\u2019ll be talking about a lot of the\u2014a lot of the cities and geographic areas.\n\r\n\r\n I aligned the supply chain to those geographic areas to try to get as much there, while we realize the rest of the nation needs supplies as well. And then we aligned to the supply chain to site of care: public hospitals, VA, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care, and on down the line.\n\r\n\r\n So the last business week\u2014so, Monday of last week through Friday, Saturday of the past week\u2014these are the mass materials that came into the New York, New Jersey metro area, and you can see the volumes there.\n\r\n\r\n So if you go to Detroit, we talked about their hotspot. Here\u2019s the volumes of deliveries going into Detroit for that same time period.\n\r\n\r\n If you can go to Chicago. And I\u2019m going to run through this kind of quick, but you can see that the geographic alignment, the places that Dr. Birx has talked about is where we\u2019re concentrating supplies.\n\r\n\r\n You can go to New Orleans, to give you an understanding. Washington D.C., right? So now I can talk about that. Today was a\u2014you know, a very, kind of, early entry into the Washington, D.C., Baltimore\u2014right?\u2014positioning supplies ahead of need, we hope, in Washington.\n\r\n\r\n Go to Baltimore, and you can see trying to\u2014the volumes there, trying to get ahead of that. And then Philadelphia is next.\n\r\n\r\n And then now the next slide is a nine-city roll-up. And so to save a little time, I did not include Boston and Houston in there. So you can see the volume of material flowing through a commercial network air bridge, their supplies, into geographic regions and then\u2014and then further prioritize to site of care.\n\r\n\r\n Now, final topic: N95 masks. So the Department of Defense announced a DPA action this weekend. That came over from DOD on Friday, into the White House, approved on Saturday. And contract awarded today $131 million, five companies: 3M, Honeywell, Owens &amp; Minor, Moldex, and Draeger.\n\r\n\r\n You know, the CARES Act was signed before the\u2014before March was end\u2014towards the end there. So essentially two weeks from that money being put into the Title III authority for DOD. This action takes us from a baseline of what\u2014what was being produced domestically of about 30 million masks upwards to, as we go through the fall into the end of the winter, 120 million masks domestically.\n\r\n\r\n So, currently, we\u2019re filling some of that demand from overseas sources. Right? And so the additive masks here, through this, will ramp up, lower dependence on overseas sources, and that\u2014that will essentially secure a big piece of the supply chain.\n\r\n\r\n Five companies, six\u2014six cities: Smithfield, Rhode Island; Phoenix, Arizona; Del Rio, Texas; Lexington, North Carolina; Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin; and Aberdeen, North Dakota\u2014all either producing more fabric or increasing production facilities to have that ramp up.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Great. Great job. Thank you, Admiral.\n\r\n\r\n And can we put that slide\u2014I guess it\u2019s still up. This is for just the week ending April 11. We have distributed or directed the distribution of 5.3 million N95 masks, 5.5 million surgical masks, 110 million gloves. We shared that mostly just to make sure our healthcare workers know that the resources are flowing, we\u2019re going to continue to flow them, but this is just the numbers for this week and don\u2019t include, for instance, what the President announced.\n\r\n\r\n I was able to tell Governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania today that, next week, they\u2019ll be receiving 2 million N95 masks to support some of the healthcare challenges that they\u2019re facing in the broader Philadelphia area.\n\r\n\r\n So, with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take a couple of questions. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Thank you so much. One for the Admiral and then one for Dr. Fauci, if you don\u2019t mind.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Please.\n\r\n\r\n Q:&nbsp;Admiral, wouldn\u2019t it have been useful, as you\u2019re going through, you know, all of those supplies that are now making their way into the system\u2014you talked about having to buy foreign products, you know, as we\u2019re catching up and making it\u2014wouldn\u2019t it have been useful if it hadn\u2019t taken until mid-March for the government to start placing bulk orders for these kinds of supplies?\n\r\n\r\n REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK: Okay so, I came over from the Pentagon the 20th of March, so I\u2019ll speak from the 20th March on now. We\u2019re using the Defense Production Act. I think you\u2019ll see much more use of that as we go forward. You know, we make \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Sir, but my question is about the timing here and that lost time that the President earlier today denied.\n\r\n\r\n REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK: I know. And I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not equipped to talk about\u2014other than from about the 20th of March forward. I just\u2014I wasn\u2019t\u2014I was over at the Joint Staff. I wasn\u2019t involved.\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay.\n\r\n\r\n Q: And I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fauci.\n\r\n\r\n Q:\u2014you know, you said that you\u2019d be, you know, giving the President your recommendations, you and Dr. Birx, coming up with a plan that you guys are comfortable with. Are you willing, once the President has made his decision, are you willing to come here and tell us, tell the American public, what you actually had recommended to him and whether he followed through with what you recommended?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: I\u2019m not really\u2014what do you mean? Like \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: So when the President stands up here, whether it\u2019s, you know, May 1st\u2014whatever day it is\u2014and outlines his plan, are you willing to stand up here after him and tell us all, tell the American public, what it was that you had recommended he do if there is a difference?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: You know, I have to think about that because, you know, when you have conversations with the President, sometimes they really should be confidential in what you give him because he\u2019s going to have to make his own choice.\n\r\n\r\n I\u2019d have to think about that.\n\r\n\r\n Q: So that way we would know whether he was actually listening to the health advice that he\u2019s being provided.\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Right. Yeah. He is. I mean, he\u2014I can tell you one thing: He\u2019ll listen. But I think what\u2019s going to happen\u2014you know, I don\u2019t know for sure\u2014is that he will get input from a number of individuals representing a number of aspects of society; one of them will be health. The only thing that I can tell you is that I will give him the advice based on evidence, my observation of what the best public health approach would be.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Dr. Fauci?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Yeah.\n\r\n\r\n Q: Just to go back to where we started today, which was with the President\u2019s seeming frustrations with some of the reporting about his early decision-making process in January and February.\n\r\n\r\n As I\u2019m sure you know, the reason we, in the press, do that kind of reporting is so that the next President that comes along, has to deal with a pandemic, can learn some of these lessons.\n\r\n\r\n What\u2014having watched this unfold up close, what do you think were the mistakes that were made early on that a future President could learn from? With the benefit of hindsight, of course.\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: You know, I \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Because no President gets everything right, obviously.\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: I understand. I don\u2019t want to use the word \u201cmistakes,\u201d because when you\u2019re in the\u2014in the fog of war when you\u2019re doing something, you have to make decisions. You get input from a number of individuals. It\u2019s always a moving target. And I just don\u2019t want to be\u2014have anything taken out of context because I already had one of those already in the last couple of days\u2014(laughs)\u2014so I don\u2019t want to go through it again.\n\r\n\r\n I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cmistake.\u201d Could things have done better? Of course. I mean, nothing is perfect. And you could always do better. But, I mean, I hesitate to say something is a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n Q: But with the benefit of hindsight, with that caveat, what could have been done better?\n\r\n\r\n DR. FAUCI: Well, I mean, I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t comment about anything outside of my own field. But the thing that, when I think back on, was evolving, in my mind, was something that was a virus that was much worse than what I had thought it was going to be, based on what we had learned early on, when it was first felt to be something that just jumped from an animal to a human, and really didn\u2019t have much capability of going human to human. And then, all of a sudden, you find out that not only was it not just animal to human, but there were a lot of\u2014that\u2019s probably the way it started.\n\r\n\r\n But then, as you go back and you realize there were probably a lot of infections, that maybe if we had dealt into that a little bit more, we could have learned that not only is it affecting human to human, but it\u2019s transmitting really efficiently.\n\r\n\r\n When I question myself\u2014I\u2019m not perfect; maybe I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say made \u201cmistakes,\u201d but maybe I should have really tried to delve into that a little bit more about what was going on, but the information wasn\u2019t as forthcoming as I would have liked.\n\r\n\r\n And then, all of a sudden, when you find out that you\u2019re dealing with something that is not only what had been your worst nightmare\u2014because people ask me that: \u201cWhat is your worst nightmare?\u201d\u2014a brand-new virus that\u2019s respiratory transmitted, that has a high degree of transmissibility, that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. You know, is that a mistake? Maybe I should have been able to realize that earlier. I\u2019m not sure it was a mistake; it was just an evolving thing that we finally realized and said, \u201cWhoa, this is really worse than we could have imagined.\u201d\n\r\n\r\n AIDE: All right. Last one, guys.\n\r\n\r\n Q: When you met with Abbott Laboratories today, what did you ask them to do? What did they say they could do?\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we spoke with Abbott Laboratories today about how we can increase significantly the production of cartridges for the 15-minute test. Because, remember, we\u2019re\u2014we are\u2014we\u2019re not only scaling to rapidly expand testing across the country today. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why you heard me and Dr. Birx say that we are\u2014we have an entire team now that\u2019s going to be working with governors and with laboratories around the country to identify the machines that already exist today and that could be activated in doing tests.\n\r\n\r\n But we also\u2014we also want to work with Abbott Laboratories for the longer term. Because if the current trend lines hold\u2014and I hope and I literally pray that we will soon find ourselves on the downslope of the coronavirus in this country\u2014this epidemic, in its current form, will come to an end.\n\r\n\r\n But as we make decisions in the days ahead to reopen America, what President Trump also wants to do is have a policy in place to stay open. And having the kind of surveillance testing available around the country so that CDC can do the immediate contact tracing, when you have a positive test, so that we can deploy resources like the new Abbott 15-minute test specifically to nursing homes.\n\r\n\r\n We spoke today to Governor Baker in Massachusetts, to Governor Hogan in Maryland, both of whom who have been very innovative implementing federal guidelines for preventing the spread of infectious disease at nursing homes, and we commend them for that. But being able to increase the manufacture of those devices so they can be deployed going forward in the months ahead is also a focal point of our efforts.\n\r\n\r\n So, rapidly continuing to expand testing today. And the governor of Louisiana told me today that they had tested at the highest per capita\u2014according to his numbers\u2014of any state in the union. And we congratulate him for that. But making sure that, going forward, we\u2019ll have the infrastructure of testing all across America to deal with the coronavirus should it return in the future.\n\r\n\r\n With that, let me\u2014let me bid you all a good evening. And we will be back tomorrow. And \u2014\n\r\n\r\n Q: Mr. Vice President \u2014\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead.\n\r\n\r\n Q: I just have a question about these cartridges and this timeline because the New Hampshire governor says the federal government is in charge of distributing those\u2014FEMA is. So what is the timeline for when they\u2019ll have enough of them? Because they say they don\u2019t have enough. Illinois said they didn\u2019t have enough. So what\u2019s the timeline that you\u2019re working with?\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, let me\u2014let me let Dr. Birx address that. But there\u2019s a\u2014there was an initial tranche that we purchased. There\u2019s some 18,000 Abbott Laboratory machines around the country, and FEMA acquired a certain amount that were immediately distributed across the states.\n\r\n\r\n But now Abbott Laboratories is literally producing some 50,000 a day, and those are available in the open market. And we\u2019re also going to be working with Abbott and with the states to deploy those resources.\n\r\n\r\n And we\u2019re also working with other manufacturers to increase the production of cartridges. But if there\u2019s more to that that you want to add, Deb, we\u2019ll make it the last.\n\r\n\r\n DR. BIRX: No, that was perfectly said. I just want to\u2014sometimes you ask those questions, and I always want to make sure that people understand.\n\r\n\r\n So, a third of them went specifically to Indian Health Service and to these states that have smaller epidemics. Two thirds of it went into the public market, mostly targeted to the places where there is high disease. But only two thirds went that way so that people could purchase them directly, and one third went to the Indian Health Service and to the smaller states that really need these.\n\r\n\r\n And so I think what we\u2019re trying to do now is balance the entire testing framework of medium-, low-, and high-throughput machines to give everyone the maximum flexibility, state by state, based on what the needs are at that moment.\n\r\n\r\n If there\u2019s an outbreak and you have to do 5,000 tests, you\u2019re not going to do them on an ID NOW machine that takes 15 minutes for every negative, but you\u2019re going to do it on your high-throughput machine. So making sure everybody knows where everything is and what is being run will be really critical moving forward, because we can\u2019t leave anything not on \u2013everything has to be on the table in order for us to be able to dramatically increase testing yet another\u2014we went up by a log in three weeks. So if we\u2019re going to increase again, it\u2019s going to have to be getting every piece of equipment on\n\r\n\r\n THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let just again say thank you all for your time and attention. And thanks to every American who\u2019s joined us tonight.\n\r\n\r\n I just want to encourage you we\u2019re going to continue to lean into this effort, to expand testing across the country, to deploy supplies to our incredible healthcare workers that have done such an amazing job in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic.\n\r\n\r\n But my last word, on behalf of the President, on behalf of our entire task force is: It\u2019s \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread.\u201d And I know we\u2019re almost at the halfway point, and I know it\u2019s been a month of these mitigation strategies, but I hope as you look on, as you see the progress that\u2019s made on the West Coast, the beginnings of real progress in the Greater New York City area, Louisiana, Detroit, and elsewhere\u2014I hope it will only steel your resolve to continue to do your part to slow the spread, because we\u2019ll get through this, but it\u2019ll take all of us to continue to do it.\n\r\n\r\n So thank you to the American people for all your efforts, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\n\r\n\r\n &nbsp;", "transcript_html": "<p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, everyone. My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We\u2019re speaking with the governors and representatives. FEMA is already on its way, and they got there\u2014as soon as we heard the word, I said, \u201cGet out there.\u201d So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does. It\u2019s, really, something very special.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we\u2019re with you all the way. It\u2019s a tough deal. That was a bad, bed level five. That was a bad group. That\u2019s as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes. Something that\u2019s something incredible, the power\u2014the horrible, destructive power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide. Flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It\u2019s been incredible what they\u2019ve done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You looked at the charts, and the charts are\u2014and the models from early on\u2014predictions were 100 [thousand] and 120,000 people look like. If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we\u2019re going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it\u2019s still just a horrible thing all over the world. A hundred and eighty-four countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much. Tony, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Thank you, Mr. President. Just one\u2014a couple of things, and then I just want to make a comment about something that happened yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You\u2019re going to hear from Dr. Birx soon about the numbers that we\u2019ve been talking about and how things are starting to balance off. And I think the more, as we go by each day, I think we\u2019re going to see\u2014and again, I never like to get ahead of myself or of Dr. Birx, but it looks like even though we\u2019ve had a really bad week last week\u2014remember, when I was speaking to you before, I was saying this was really a bad week\u2014there\u2019s still going to be a lot of deaths, but we\u2019re starting to see in some areas now that kind of flattening, particularly in a place that was a hotspot like New York. That\u2019s the first thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second thing is that I had a really very, very productive conversation with the Congressional Black Caucus this morning, for about an hour, and they really wanted to know what exactly are we going to be doing in the immediate, as well as the long range, about the health disparities and the discrepancies both in infection and in poor outcome in the minorities in general, but specifically African American.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, I mean, I made it very clear to them that what we have to do is focus on getting the resources where the vulnerable are, to be able to get testing done, to be able to get the appropriate identification, where proper and where appropriate, to isolate and contact trace if we can, but also to help mitigate in a community that is suffering and suffering much more disproportionately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I just wanted to get that out of the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other point I wanted to make is that I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question. And hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty because it\u2019s what \u201cwould have\u201d or \u201ccould have.\u201d The nature of the hypothetical question was: If, in fact, we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved? And the answer to my question was, as I always do\u2014and I\u2019m doing right now\u2014perfectly honestly say, \u201cyes.\u201d I mean, obviously. If you\u2014mitigation helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works. So if mitigation works, and you instigated and\u2014you initiated earlier, you will probably have saved more lives. If you initiated it later, you probably would have lost more lives, if you initiated at a certain time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was taken as a way that maybe, somehow, something was at fault here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let me tell you from my experience\u2014and I can only speak from my own experience\u2014is that we had been talking, before any meetings that we had, about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness or not, of strong mitigations. So discussions were going on mostly among the medical people about what that would mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to actually have a, quote, \u201cshutdown\u201d in the sense of\u2014not really \u201cshutdown\u201d but to really have strong mitigation, we discussed it. Obviously, there would be concern by some that, in fact, that might have some negative consequences. Nonetheless, the President listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next second time that I went with Dr. Birx in\u2014to the President and said, \u201cFifteen days are not enough. We need to go thirty days,\u201d obviously, there were people who had a problem with that because of the potential secondary effects. Nonetheless, at that time, the President went with the health recommendations, and we extended it another 30 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were. But, clearly, as happens all the time, there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn\u2019t have the chance to clarify.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The date on that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Excuse me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: You know, to be honest with you, I don\u2019t even remember what the date was. But I can just tell you the first and only time that I went in and said we should do mitigation strongly, the response was, \u201cYes, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And what did he do? Was that the travel restrictions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: No. The travel restriction is separate. That was whether or not we wanted to go into a mitigation stage of 15 days of mitigation. The travel was another recommendation, when we went in and said, \u201cWe probably should be doing that.\u201d And the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d And then another time was, \u201cWe should do it with Europe,\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d And the next time, \u201cWe should do it with the UK,\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: In this interview, you said there was pushback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Where did that pushback come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: No, it wasn\u2019t\u2014that was the wrong choice of words. You know what it was? When people discuss, not necessarily in front of the President\u2014when people discuss, they say, \u201cWell, you know, this is going to have maybe a harmful effect on this or on that.\u201d So it was a poor choice of words. There wasn\u2019t anybody saying, \u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Are you doing this voluntarily? Or did the President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: No, I\u2019m doing it \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014or Vice President ask you to do this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Everything I do is voluntarily. Please. Don\u2019t even imply that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So, Mr. President, the question is \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And, by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. The travel ban was done earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You couldn\u2019t give us a date when he talked to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And if you look at statistics\u2014I happened to write a couple of them down. If you look at statistics\u2014so, on January 6th\u2014that\u2019s long before the dates you\u2019re talking about\u2014there were\u2014CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice, before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That\u2019s on January 6th. This is all documented. Because we have so much fake news, I like to document things. January 6th, long before the dates we\u2019re talking about, CDC issued travel notice to Wuhan\u2014for Wuhan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don\u2019t have any cases. So there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a level one travel notice health\u2014for health, while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I\u2019m supposed to close down the economy\u2014the greatest economy in the history of the world\u2014and we don\u2019t have one case confirmed in the United States. That\u2019s January 11th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 17th, the CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn\u2019t a case, and the fake news is saying, \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t act fast enough.\u201d Well, you remember what happened. Because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by Sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats and some others\u2014not too many others, actually. So that\u2014by the media, definitely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, on January 21st\u2014this is long before the time we\u2019re talking, because when Tony is talking, I believe he\u2019s talking about the end of February. On January 21st, okay\u2014still early\u2014there was one case of the virus. At that time, we called it the \u201cWuhan virus,\u201d right? Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We have one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from you people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On January 21st, the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That\u2019s why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States. You know they used the ad, \u201cThere\u2019s only one person\u2026\u201d That statement was made at that time. One case. In the whole United States, one case. I\u2019m supposed to shut down the government? The biggest\u2014the biggest economy in the history of the world. \u201cShut it down. We have one case.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven cases were on January 31st. Now, on January 21st, there was a case. Not one person had died. You heard that, Steve, right? Not one person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world\u2014bigger than China\u2019s, by a lot\u2014right?\u2014because of what we\u2019ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had; the highest employment numbers; the best employment numbers; best unemployment numbers also. The best of everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, on January 31st\u2014think of it\u2014not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, Jon. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find any. This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news\u2014which doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because they don\u2019t tell the truth. But CDC reported: January 31st, not one person has died.<br />\r\nAnd I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died, and I issued. You can\u2019t get earlier than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we have nobody died, and I said, \u201cChina, you can\u2019t come in. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Because I saw what was going on. It wasn\u2019t so much what I was told; it was that I saw what was going on and I didn\u2019t like it. But I didn\u2019t speak to Tony about it. Didn\u2019t speak to very many people about it. I didn\u2019t like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what did I do? Ready? January 31st: In the United States, not one person had died because of the\u2014again, the Wuhan virus. So I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died, and I got brutalized over it by the press because I was way too early; I shouldn\u2019t have done it. Brutalized by the press. But, you know, sort of\u2014I\u2019ve been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics. But I guess I\u2019m doing okay because, to the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m the President of the United States, despite the things that are said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats and the media called \u201cxenophobic.\u201d Now, Joe Biden said, \u201cHe\u2019s a racist.\u201d He called me a racist because I said, \u201cWe\u2019re shutting down entry from China. We\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d He called me xenophobic, and he called me racist and other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a state-\u2014it wasn\u2019t him; he didn\u2019t write it. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t even know that it was issued. But the people from his campaign\u2014who are smart. The people that write those little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good. Not the best, but they\u2019re not bad. But they issued a statement, saying that Joe Biden agrees that the Pres-\u2014that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now, he did that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, he issued it on Friday night. We\u2019ve all heard about that, Jon\u2014Friday nights, right? In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday night. Okay?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: (Inaudible) seems pretty late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: So he did\u2014he did it pretty late. I mean, you know, like at 11 o\u2019clock in the evening or something. You know, that\u2019s pretty late. Anyway. So Joe Biden issued\u2014and it\u2019s one of those things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, in February, Nancy Pelosi said we should come to Chinatown. This is late February. \u201cCome to Chinatown. We think it\u2019s very safe. Come here. Let\u2019s all have the big parade\u2014Chinatown parade.\u201d Probably referring to San Francisco. And that\u2019s it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I took this action early. And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It\u2019s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday\u2014hopefully in five years, when I\u2019m not here\u2014those papers are all going out of business because nobody is going to want to read them. But now they like them because they write about me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, with that, I have a couple of interesting\u2014we have a few clips that we\u2019re just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you\u2019ll find them interesting. And then we\u2019ll answer some questions. I\u2019ll ask you some questions because you\u2019re so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we\u2019re going to get back onto the reason we\u2019re here, which is the success we\u2019re having. Okay?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please, you could put it on. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(A video is played.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors\u2014including Democratic or \u201cDemocrat,\u201d as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn\u2019t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it\u2019s\u2014you know, it\u2019s very sad when people write false stories like, in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from the New York Times, which is a highly\u2014I mean, if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they\u2019ll end up going out of business. So it\u2019s too bad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we could have given you\u2014you saw the statements. We have hundreds of statements. Hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you look, they were all saying, \u201cWe need ventilators. We need\u2026\u201d You don\u2019t hear \u201cventilators\u201d anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for too many. You don\u2019t need that.\u201d And, in all fairness, these two people right here\u2014Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci\u2014they said, \u201cI don\u2019t think they need that many ventilators.\u201d And I said, \u201cI agree.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one point\u2014and I\u2019m not knocking New York for this, but they were asking\u2014you remember?\u201440,000 ventilators. And that\u2019s more than they have all over the country. And we got them a lot of ventilators, and nobody has complained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got them, as you know, beautiful\u2014we built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, \u201cYou know what? You don\u2019t have to build a second hospital.\u201d Because good news is happening. They\u2019re not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one; it was perfect. We\u2019re getting\u2014we\u2019re just starting the other. I called him up. I said, \u201cDo you think we should build the second one? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d He said, \u201cLet me get back.\u201d He got back. We didn\u2019t need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done. And we built 2,900 incredible beds. Incredible. Then we make it\u2014we made it COVID\u2014and\u2014or, to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, and\u2014which was a lot of work. We had to change the ductwork. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work. And we had it\u2014but they never really had too much use for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And they called also\u2014Mayor de Blasio, rightfully, he called. He said, \u201cWould it be possible to get more medical help?\u201d So, now, not only are we building facilities, we\u2019re\u2014they\u2019re asking us for help because they\u2019re unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, when the Javits Center wasn\u2019t used much\u2014and then, as you know, the Mercy\u2014and we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort, and we made them both\u2014Los Angeles and New York\u2014we made them COVID-adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn\u2019t get almost any people sent there. They didn\u2019t need them at the beginning because they didn\u2019t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what we did was like an incredible job, but they didn\u2019t need them. It turned out\u2014they were there. We were ready. You know the expression? They have an expression: \u201cReady, willing, and able.\u201d We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What\u2014what FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, \u201cCould you help us even more with medical personnel?\u201d And we sent\u2014I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts. Real experts. And I got a call from the mayor and he said, \u201cI want to tell you: Incredible\u2014these people are incredible.\u201d He said, \u201cThey lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He\u2019s\u2014he was unbelievable, what he said. It was really appreciated. And I let them know that. I let the military people\u2014he said, \u201cThey went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories, you\u2014nobody\u2014nobody acknowledges this. And it doesn\u2019t have to be acknowledged, from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors, nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA\u2014all these people, they\u2019ve done this incredible job. And they shouldn\u2019t be abused because\u2014you take a look at what\u2019s happened. Nobody is asking for ventilators, except outside of our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of our country, they\u2019re calling me\u2014every country. They\u2019re calling me. So many countries. And I\u2019m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody is asking for ventilators. Nobody is asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The job they\u2019ve done is incredible. With all of that being said, I\u2019m getting along very well with governors. And if I wouldn\u2019t, Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10. I said, \u201cHow was it?\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a 10.\u201d He was one of my expressions, actually. But he said it was like a 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I\u2019m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren\u2019t supposed to be. But you were sitting in somebody\u2019s office listening to it, because every time we have these\u2014and, you know, and you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good. But there wasn\u2019t a raised voice. There wasn\u2019t even a statement of like, \u201cWe think you should do this or that.\u201d I heard it was, like, just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They\u2019ll say, \u201cI thought that somebody maybe slightly raised\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t even raise a voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My only point of saying this, because I want to get back to why we\u2019re here: The press has not treated these incredible people who\u2019ve done such a great job, they haven\u2019t treated them fairly. They\u2019re way off. We were way ahead of schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And remember this\u2014because the Times story was a fake\u2014but everything\u2014remember this: Everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, it would have been\u2014you would have been critic-\u2014if I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized\u2014you know, criticized for being way too early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I\u2019ve educated a lot of people as to the press. And I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, Jon, there\u2019d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work\u2014and I don\u2019t mind being criticized, but not when they\u2019re wrong. Not when people have done a great job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Can I just ask you about the video? Because I\u2019ve never seen a video like that played in this room. It looks a bit like a campaign ad. Who\u2014who produced that video for you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by\u2014we just put some clips together.&nbsp; I could give you\u2014I\u2019ll bet you I have over 100 more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just\u2014oh, we have far better than that. That\u2019s nothing compared to some of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But this was produced here in the White House by \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Why did you feel the need to do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Because we\u2019re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They\u2019re saying what a great job we\u2019re doing, and the media\u2014these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look, in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators\u2014we\u2019re going to be probably\u2014we didn\u2019t\u2014they didn\u2019t have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of\u2014thousands, but we got them a tremendous number of ventilator. You don\u2019t hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I\u2019m happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s good news, not bad news. I\u2019m\u2014you know, I\u2019m not saying, \u201cGee, I wish more people were there.\u201d I don\u2019t want more people there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort. And the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all\u2014the coronavirus. It was not supposed to be for that at all. They called, they said, \u201cCould we have it?\u201d That was a number of weeks ago. We said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you need it, but if you need it, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d Then they said, \u201cCould you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?\u201d We said, \u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, we will.\u201d And we did. There were military personnel. That\u2019s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to, in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery. They\u2019re great people, the military people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we pieced that together\u2014I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But just to be clear, this was produced by government employees, by people here at the White House\u2014this campaign-style video here?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn\u2019t use the word \u201cproduced.\u201d All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s not going to have any impact. But just think of it: You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people wish we never closed it down. Now, if we didn\u2019t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people. You know, interestingly\u2014so I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m against that. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You don\u2019t think you made any mistakes along the way here? You think everything you did was right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well\u2014well, look, governors should have had ventilators; they chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven\u2019t heard\u2014other than, you know, there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, \u201cWe want ventilators.\u201d They got the ventilators. You don\u2019t have that anymore. And the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, Jon, we\u2019ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2,000 in New York, which you don\u2019t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We\u2019re ready to rock. This was a great\u2014this was a great military\u2014and beyond that\u2014operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s get back to the regular. Shouldn\u2019t we get back to the regular? We could talk about this, but all I\u2019m doing is this: I could have given you\u2014like, those are four or five clips that we just played for you. I could have given you hundreds of people\u2014I mean, Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors, singing praises. He says, \u201cLook\u2026\u201d You know, the question was asked in a negative way. He said, \u201cLook, I know what you want to say but\u2014want me to say, but he\u2019s been really good. It\u2019s hard for me to say that. In fact, it\u2019s impossible for me to say it.\u201d Gavin Newsom, the governor of California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have many clips from many\u2014I have some clips from Anthony, that I didn\u2019t want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say, when I closed the country to China, when I closed the\u2014the China ban, whatever you want to call it\u2014Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don\u2019t want to put words in Anthony\u2019s mouth, by the way, and I like him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I walk in and I hear I\u2019m going to fire him. I\u2019m not firing\u2014I think he\u2019s a wonderful guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But why did you tweet something that said \u201cFire Fauci\u201d? Why did you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You retweeted the hashtag #FireFauci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I retweeted somebody. I don\u2019t know. They said \u201cfire.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Did you notice that when you retweeted it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I notice everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So you retweeted it even though it said, \u201cTime to fire Fauci\u201d?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, no, that\u2019s somebody\u2019s opinion. All that is is an opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But you read it and you elevated it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, I was called about that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not firing him.\u201d In fact, if you ask your friends in the office\u2014in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that. And I said, \u201cNo, I like him. I think he\u2019s terrific.\u201d Because this was a person\u2019s view. Not everybody is happy with Anthony. Not everybody is happy with everybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I will tell you, we have done a job, the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we\u2019ve done\u2014nobody has ever done a job like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have 50 governors\u2014and territories, by the way. People don\u2019t ever mention that we have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats, and they can\u2019t find anything to complain about. And honestly, many of them didn\u2019t do their jobs. I\u2019ll let you know someday\u2014let\u2019s see what happens\u2014but I may let you know who\u2019s not doing their job. I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. But we help some of the ones that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They should have had their own stockpiles. And now, if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hardest thing is a ventilator, because it\u2019s expensive, it takes a while to get. We got them, and nobody believed we did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many. And we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said\u2014you said very strongly that they just don\u2019t need that many. You said they don\u2019t need that many beds\u2014Deborah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that\u2019s it.&nbsp; Steve, go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: To be clear, you and Dr. Fauci are on the same page?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don\u2019t know what it is exactly. But if I put somebody\u2019s opinion up\u2014you know, I don\u2019t mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing. But I want it to be honest controversy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, when I got a call\u2014I got a call not very quickly; nobody, you know, saw that as being any big deal\u2014they said, \u201cHow are you doing with Dr. Fauci?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m doing great.\u201d And I didn\u2019t talk to Dr. Fauci, even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So he said that once you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Can I\u2014can I ask you? He said the question was hypothetical. But what he was just acknowledging is that lives would have been saved if the mitigation practices were put into place earlier. That seems obvious. Do you not agree with that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Here\u2019s the thing. No, no. What he really is saying though: \u201cBut how could you have done it?\u201d Look, I just went over stats with you. Right here. Right here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America?\u201d \u201cOh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d How many deaths do we have?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>January 17th\u2014go back another week. On January 17th\u2014this is 10 days before I did the\u2014little bit less than 10 days before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe. And a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do, because you look at Spain\u2014and, by the way, we\u2019re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low, and per capita we\u2019re very low. We\u2019re doing very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how do you close up the United States of America? So, on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths. And no\u2014no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I\u2019m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You didn\u2019t close down until the middle of March. \u201cShould you have closed it down earlier?\u201d\u2014that\u2019s the question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I closed down from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It\u2019s not about January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And, by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them. Okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would have said, \u201cLet\u2019s ride it out.\u201d Now, I\u2019ll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I did this last time: Cut it in half. Don\u2019t say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half. Say a million people died\u2014well, that\u2019s much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half; that\u2019s 500,000 people would have died. Now, that number we would have reached. Okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing, and our timing was very good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here\u2019s the one thing\u2014and you have to say this\u2014when you ask me, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this?\u201d\u2014how come when I did the ban on China and some very, very\u2014instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s all march. This is not going to happen\u201d? How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks\u2014if you call CNN a network; I don\u2019t, personally. But we have CNN, we have many other places, and they\u2019re all saying, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to do it. He doesn\u2019t need to do it.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All I\u2019m saying is this: How do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world when, on January 17th, you have no cases and no death; when on January 21st, you have one case and no death? One case. Think of it. Now, we\u2019re supposed to close down the country?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here\u2019s what happened: When, on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need the ban. You\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t go crazy. Like, he has\u2014he didn\u2019t even know what the hell the ban was. But he\u2014so he didn\u2019t go crazy. But he did say \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Your ban bought you time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: He did call me xenophobic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What did you do with that time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. He called me xenophobic; he called me a racist because\u2014he has since apologized and he said I did the right thing. So when you say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this?\u201d Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives, by doing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But what did you do with that time that you bought? The argument is that you bought yourself some time and you didn\u2019t use it to prepare hospitals, you didn\u2019t use it to ramp up testing. Right now \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re so\u2014you\u2019re so \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014nearly 20 million people are unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re so disgraceful. It\u2019s so disgraceful the way you say that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Tens of thousands of Americans are dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me just\u2014listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: How is this sizzle reel \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I just went over it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014or this rant supposed to make people feel confident \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I just went over it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014in an unprecedented crisis?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody thought we should do it. And when I did it \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But what did you do with the time that you bought?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You know what we did?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The month of February. That \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You know what we did?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: That video has a gap. The entire month of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: What do you do\u2014what do you do when you have no case in the whole United States when you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You had cases in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. You reported it: zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: January, February\u2014the entire month of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: January. I said in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Your video has a complete gap: the month of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: On January 30th \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What did your administration do in February with the time that your travel ban bought you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot. And, in fact, we\u2019ll give you a list\u2014what we did. In fact, part of it was up there. We did a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It wasn\u2019t in the video. The video had a gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Look. Look, you know you\u2019re a fake. You know that. Your whole network\u2014the way you cover it\u2014is fake. And most of you\u2014and not all of you\u2014but the people are wise to you. That\u2019s why you have a lower\u2014a lower approval rating than you\u2019ve ever had before, times probably three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Twenty million people now are unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And when you ask me that questions \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Tens of thousands of people are dead, Mr. President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me ask you this: Why didn\u2019t Biden\u2014why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I don\u2019t think the unemployed people right now care about why Joe Biden didn\u2019t apologize to you, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So get us the list of what you did in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Now, I could\u2019ve\u2014I could\u2019ve kept it open. And I could\u2019ve done what some countries are doing. They\u2019re getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody has ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would have done that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve done this right. And we really\u2014we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn\u2019t cover it the way it should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go ahead. One more question. Steve, go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: There\u2019s a debate over what authority you have to order the country reopened. What authority do you have?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we\u2019re going to get into that in a minute. We\u2019re going to just finish this up. We\u2019re going to tell you about other things that we\u2019ve done right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I will say this: Had we said, \u201cLet\u2019s just keep going and let\u2019s not do a closing\u201d\u2014whether it\u2019s 2.2 that they, at one point, predicted as an outside or 1.6 at a lower number; you cut it all the way down to 6- or 7- or 800,000; take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the minimum number was 100,000. And I think\u2014I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the 100,000. And I hope we will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All right. So, today, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot, by the way\u2014which you didn\u2019t like to talk about\u2014in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received, today, 1,300 additional ventilators. Now, we\u2019re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big, and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We\u2019re ready to\u2014we\u2019re ready to rock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contracts are with General Electric, Hillrom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire, combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Philips and two other contracts with Hamilton and ZOLL. We\u2019re adding 6,190 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile, of which we have a lot already\u2014thousands\u2014close to 10,000. But this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May. And more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, we\u2019re going to help other countries. We\u2019re going to help states if they need it. We may help some states\u2019 stockpile. You know, they\u2019re supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They\u2019re supposed to be using that. And unfortunately, most of the states weren\u2019t there. And a lot of people didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but they weren\u2019t there. We will talk about it at the right time, if you want to. I\u2014at this point, I\u2019m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic\u2014anything you want to call it. We got to get past it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators. \u201cWe need ventilators.\u201d Because they didn\u2019t have them. Because the states should have had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That\u2019s not even really our responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if we can help, we\u2019re going to do it. But that\u2019s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we\u2019ve actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe and we really\u2014they rose to this incredible occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought, in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the governor, I said, \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t build that second hospital, because we don\u2019t want to build it if you don\u2019t need it.\u201d He called back, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need it.\u201d They had 1,000 rooms, 1,000 beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn\u2019t need the other one so we stopped it because we don\u2019t want to waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we\u2019re prepared to build thousands more should we need it. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need it because it looks like we\u2019re plateauing and maybe even, in many cases, coming down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we\u2019ve ordered a total of 60 mobile decontamidation [sic]\u2014-contamination systems. So the decontamination system from Battelle, in Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks, and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I\u2019ve been asking from the beginning: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?\u201d And it turned out we can. And there was a great company in Ohio, they sent us some great equipment, and they\u2019re doing that now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now we\u2019re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it\u2019ll be great. It\u2019s something that, frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge\u2014our massive air lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks, and 4.9 million gowns. So, we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the states\u2014the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff. But should they need it, we are ready to give them, because we\u2019re building up our stockpile again like crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, I\u2014and you saw the stories. I inherited\u2014this administration\u2014Mike, myself, the whole administration, we inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing. And I say it and I\u2019ll say it again: Just like we didn\u2019t have ammunition, we didn\u2019t have medical supplies, we didn\u2019t have ventilators, we didn\u2019t have a lot of things that should have been had. And you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened: They didn\u2019t want to spend the money. But we did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, we\u2019ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week, we\u2019ll be sending 2 million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He\u2019s got great detail on that, and I think it\u2019s a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock, and we have more coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients, including at the East Orange, New Jersey Medical Center, as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They\u2019re ready. They\u2019re able. They\u2019re beautiful. Hopefully, we won\u2019t need too many of them because, frankly, we built everything that the governors wanted. And in many cases, it\u2019s too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus. Three million\u2014the most of any nation. We are performing approximately 150,000 tests every single day and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus, if you look. And that\u2019s really\u2014and it has hit some areas\u2014the virus\u2014very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NIH, CDC, and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We\u2019re looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting, over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed, as we speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug, remdesivir, has shown promising results\u2014very promising\u2014in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted emergency use authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient\u2019s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that\u2014that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with Zinc\u2014depending on your doctor\u2019s recommendation. And it\u2019s having some very good results, I\u2019ll tell you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think if anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it\u2019s a lot of good things that are happening with it. A lot of good tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick. And this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it\u2019s done in a very modern way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this difficult time, we\u2019re also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy.&nbsp; We may be asking for an extension because, obviously, they can\u2019t be doing very much right now. They wouldn\u2019t even be allowed to do it. So, the Census, we\u2019re going to be asking for a delay\u2014a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporarily suspend its field operation data-collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension. I don\u2019t know that you even have to ask them. This is called \u201can act of God.\u201d This is called a\u2014a situation that has to be\u2014they have to give in. I think 120 days isn\u2019t nearly enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My administration is also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion. And from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that\u2019s very much on time and going very nicely. He\u2019ll be speaking in a moment. And payments\u2014these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400. That\u2019s for a family of four. That\u2019s something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, through our Paycheck Protection Program \u2013which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks are taking a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it\u2019s going rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds because it\u2019s really something that has been an incredible success. And they need more money to keep it going to take care of these business and keep them\u2014keep them open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month, and even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. You know, we\u2019ve been working together with a lot of for, it seems like, forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts, and we\u2019re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. And that\u2019s so important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration\u2019s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That\u2019s what we want. We want to have our country open. We want to return to normal life. Our country is going to be open, and it\u2019s going to be successfully opened. And we\u2019ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We\u2019re actually calling it a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. And we\u2019ll be announcing them tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC Plus\u2014that\u2019s OPEC plus additional energy-producing nations\u2014representing many of the world\u2019s largest oil-producing countries to stabilize oil markets. And we have, in fact\u2014and I think you\u2019ve seen a big stabilization over the last couple of days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they\u2019ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. And that will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many of other\u2014other of our big energy states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry. It\u2019s a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the King of Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia\u2014both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine\u2014a man who\u2019s become a friend of mine: The President of Mexico showed great flexibility. President L\u00f3pez Obrador. He showed great flexibility and\u2014and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him. And I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal. Very historic. So we\u2019ll see how it all goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this time and challenge\u2014and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven\u2019t been in many, many decades\u2014we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I\u2019m so proud of the American people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to happen sooner than people think. And we\u2019re going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We\u2019re going to be safe about it. We\u2019re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, we\u2019re beating back the invisible enemy and we\u2019re paving the way for great resurgence. Really, a great resurgence for American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They\u2019re going to go back safely, and that\u2019s what we want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we\u2014before we do this\u2014because I know there\u2019s an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I\u2019ll do is I\u2019ll ask Steve to come up\u2014Secretary of the Treasury. You can talk a little bit and then maybe take a couple of questions about what\u2019s happening. Tell them the success we\u2019re having.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. As you announced, we are very pleased that we are ahead of schedule on delivering the economic impact payments. These are what was known as the checks in the mail that we want to deliver in direct\u2014direct deposit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is ahead of schedule. We started processing those last Friday. We expect that over 80 million hardworking Americans will get the direct deposit by this Wednesday. And we know how important that is to all of those hardworking Americans, many of which are at home, not working at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not receive them by Wednesday\u2014on Wednesday, we will be launching at IRS.gov. Click on IRS.gov, go to \u201cGet Your Payment.\u201d If you filed a tax return in 2018 and \u201919\u2014or \u201919\u2014have that information available. You\u2019ll be able to ID yourself, you\u2019ll be able to put in your direct deposit information, and within several days, we will automatically deposit the money into your account. We want to do as much of this electronically as we can. It\u2019s very important in this day and age. It\u2019s more secure, and you don\u2019t have to go to the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re a Social Security beneficiary, you do not need to do anything. You will get a direct deposit. If you have not filed and did not need to file a 2018 and \u201819 return, you can go to IRS.gov now and enter your information and authenticate yourself. So again, we are very pleased that that is ahead of schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019d also like to announce the progress we\u2019re making on the new SBA program, the PPP. Let me just remind everybody: This is a brand-new program that is now one week old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have distributed and confirmed $230 billion of loans to over 4,600 lenders participating. That is multiples and multiples of anything that the SBA has ever done in\u2014in one year, before. And I especially want to thank the broad-based community banks that are participating. Again, over 4,600 banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven\u2019t had your loan processed, you will get it processed this week. As the President said, we\u2019ve gone back to Congress and asked them for more money to make sure that every business has access to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me also comment for the states. We are distributing out half the money, this week, to the states. That\u2019s a week ahead of time. And we\u2019ll deliver the other half of the money to the states next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then let me just finally comment, we\u2019ve been very\u2014working very closely with the Federal Reserve. Last week, we announced expanded facilities and new facilities that total $2.3 trillion of liquidity. And in particular, I\u2019d just like to highlight a Main Street lending facility that will be for companies between one worker and 10,000 people\u2014so mid-sized businesses\u2014and also, a municipal facility for states and local governments to be able to access funds given the shortages that they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So with that, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You have any questions for Steve, please?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Secretary Mnuchin, thank you, sir. Both Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have said that they\u2019re in negotiations with you right now on additional funding for these small-business loans, for that package. Leader McConnell, though, has said that nothing should be added to the package. They should just be specific to small-business loans. What is the opinion of your administration? Should there be some sort of horse-trading here or should it just be small business loans?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, the President\u2019s view and the Vice President\u2019s and my view is this was a bipartisan program. This SBA program, it wasn\u2019t a Republican program, it wasn\u2019t a Democrat program; it was a bipartisan program. We\u2019ve committed to small businesses. We should top up that program now. I know the Democrats want to talk about more money for hospitals and states. Right now, we\u2019re just sending the money out to the hospitals and states. They haven\u2019t come close to using that money. And I know the President and Vice Presidents have said once we get the SBA done, we can go into another funding bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The President has talked about potentially adding infrastructure and other things. We think there is a likelihood we will need more money, and we will\u2014we will sit down and try to get a bipartisan bill. But this is important we deliver on small businesses. Fifty percent of the people work for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What\u2019s the emergency that the President said you had to go for? The President said you had an emergency meeting \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Negotiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Over this bill?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yeah, well\u2014or because we don\u2019t want to run out of money. We\u2019ve used about $220 billion of the $350 billion. We don\u2019t want to run out of that money. We don\u2019t want to create panics that people won\u2019t get it. So that\u2019s why we want to\u2014we want to top that up, and we\u2019ve asked for another $250 billion for that program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And again, let me just remind you, every dollar we spend in this program, we save a dollar of unemployment insurance. So even though we\u2019re asking for $250 billion, it really won\u2019t cost that much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Could I follow up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What are your\u2014do you have concerns about lifting the guidelines too soon? And what\u2019s the economic impact? I understand the economic argument for getting people back to work, obviously. But what\u2019s the economic risk of lifting them too early and seeing then a spike in cases again?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, of course there\u2019s economic risks in both directions. We reviewed with the President today a very broad list of over 100 business people that are going to help advise the President on what needs to be done to reopen the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make sure\u2014and again, the combination of economic impact payments, small-business payments, enhanced unemployment insurance\u2014the President made very clear, we want to make sure that hardworking Americans have liquidity while we wait to reopen the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So do you believe the government should be re-\u2014or that the country, excuse me, should be reopened on May 1?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I\u2019ve had discussions with the President. I know he\u2019s considering it, and I believe he\u2019s going to make a decision later in the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We have to do\u2014everything has to be safe. We want safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What is your advice to the President?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: My advice is: As soon as it\u2019s ready to open and based upon the medical professionals, and\u2014and again, we\u2019re working very closely with the President and outside business leaders to develop a plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I just wonder\u2014I wanted to ask you, Mr. President, what you think\u2014what\u2014if you could sketch for us what reopening the economy looks like. Do you think it\u2019s going to be everything open? Or do you think \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019ll be doing that over the next few days because we\u2019ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the\u2014the biggest from every business on this council. We\u2019re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. And we have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But, no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we got to get our country open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah, I understand that, Mr. President. Do you think there is a possibility then that what you do is you open it incrementally? Do you think people will go back to restaurants, to concerts, the cinema?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And let me ask one final \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I think eventually they&nbsp;will do that. And I think we\u2019re going to\u2014boom\u2014I think we\u2019re going to\u2014I think it\u2019s going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there\u2019s a pent-up demand like there hasn\u2019t been in a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that\u2019s why\u2014and that\u2019s why you see the stock market\u2014I mean, to think that the stock market is at the level it is right now, with all that this world and this country has gone. And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they\u2019ve been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I\u2019ve seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much\u2014you know, it was looking a little bleak for a while, but it\u2014it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that\u2019s a great tribute to the fact that there\u2019s a demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, thank you, sir. In regards to some of your tweets earlier today, and I think it was Steve\u2019s question, my question to you is: What provision in the Constitution gives the President the power to open or close state economies? And then \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Numerous provisions. We\u2019ll give you a legal brief if you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And then\u2014we\u2019ll be looking forward to that, sir. But following up: What happens if you say, for instance, \u201cWe want states to reopen but California or New York do not open\u201d? What would you do then?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess, you know, that could happen, but I don\u2019t think that would happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go ahead please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It\u2019s been states that have closed, ordered schools closed. It\u2019s been states that have ordered businesses like restaurants and bars closed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s because I let that happen because I would have preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen and I like the way they\u2019ve done it. And the seven that remained really in sort of a semi-lockdown\u2014if you look at those states, they\u2019ve really done a very good job. They\u2019re very much different from a New York or from other places where they\u2019ve been hit very hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So you\u2019re prepared then to bigfoot states and say, \u201cI order you to open your schools, I order to force kids to be able to go\u201d?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please. Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yes, Mr. President. Following up on that, there are two consortiums of states today\u2014California, Oregon, and Washington on the West Coast; Northeastern states\u2014totally representing about 100 million people, who have said they\u2019re going to cooperate and decide when to reopen those states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, they can decide, but \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Does that undermine what you\u2019re trying to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, not at all. Let me just tell you\u2014very simple. I\u2019m going to put it very simply: The President of the United States has the authority to do what the President has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The President of the United States calls the shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we weren\u2019t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you\u2019ve never seen before. We were here to back them up. And we\u2019re backing\u2014and we\u2019ve more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It\u2019s a decision for the President of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, with that being said, we\u2019re going to work with the states because it\u2019s very important. You have local governments, they\u2019re pinpointed. It\u2019s really\u2014you talk about\u2014it\u2019s like a microchip. They are pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. And if they don\u2019t do a good job, I\u2019d step in so fast. But no, they can\u2019t do anything without the approval of the President of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But, Mr. President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So if some states refuse to reopen and you order them to, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution says all powers that don\u2019t reside in the President or Congress reside in the states. How do you overcome that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, if some states refuse to open, I would be\u2014I would like to see that person run for election. They\u2019re going to open. They\u2019re going to all open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So that\u2019s a valid (inaudible).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, some will be\u2014are in a different situation. You have\u2014I won\u2019t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I\u2019m going to be very specific. But you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard. But all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible. But they want to open safely and so do I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Today, the French President Emmanuel Macron said that he will keep the shutdown in France until the middle of May. Does that mean that the U.S. will keep the ban from flights from \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard. And again, he has to do what he has to do. He\u2019s a friend of mine. But France\u2014Spain has just been decimated. You look at what\u2019s happened in Italy, it\u2019s a very well-known fact, what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Question for Secretary Mnuchin: Has everybody that you would like to have\u2014the 100 business people on the Economic Council\u2014have they all been invited already? Have they all agreed to be \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: They ha-\u2014they haven\u2019t been invited yet. We\u2019ve just reviewed the names with the President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s a group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u2014today, for him to sign off on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And are they from all sectors? Energy \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes, there\u2019s\u2014basically, there\u2019s verticals. So every single area of the economy we wanted to be represented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Great. One other thing. Is there anything else that needs to be done to work on industry\u2014oil industry jobs\u2014to save oil industry jobs after the deal this past weekend?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think there\u2019s always things. So we\u2019re working with Larry Kudlow. I mean, we have \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Anything specifically that needs to be done?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: We have\u2014we have economic plans for every single part of the economy. Obviously, in the case of the oil industry, they\u2019ve been hit especially hard because you\u2019ve had both the supply issue and you\u2019ve had the demand issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Have you\u2014have you figured out the bailout money for the airlines, with the allocations for the airlines?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve worked very hard. I think, as you probably have seen, we\u2019ve put out a press release that we have now had discussions with almost all the airlines. I\u2019ve personally had discussions with all the major airlines\u2019 CEOs. We specifically created an exception for small airlines that we could process very quickly. And I think you\u2019ll see, very quickly, decisions coming out. I\u2019m very pleased with the discussions we\u2019ve had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019ve had very good dis-\u2014really just good discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. Secretary?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Do you still see a need for a phase four stimulus? Or is this push to reopen \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Steve, I just want to say we have had \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014the economy in lieu of that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\u2014discussions\u2014wait, excuse me. One second, please. We\u2019ve had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And is it possible to reopen the economy on May the 1st?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t want to say that. You\u2019ll be hearing over the next few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Is phase four going to be later than that, Mr. President?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN:&nbsp; Let me\u2014let me just comment\u2014I\u2019m going to answer your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. Secretary, do you see a need for a phase four? Or is this push in lieu of another stimulus?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Okay. So again, let me just comment\u2014I mean, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, approved an unprecedented amount of money to help American workers and American business because it was no fault of their own that business was closed down. We had been very diligently executing on that. You know, everybody said it was going to take months to get people money. We are executing very quickly. We created a whole new SBA program in a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our job right now is to execute the $2.3 billion, which we can add several trillion dollars with the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one area we are particularly concerned about is the Small Business program. Quite frankly, it\u2019s even more incredibly popular and successful than we anticipated. So the President wants to be very clear: We have money for that. And once we get done with that, we will review with the President. If there is more money that needs to be\u2014to support this economy, to support hardworking Americans\u2014we will work with Congress to get that in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Steve, do you want to talk about phase four?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, phase four, the President has talked about infrastructure for a long period of time. We\u2019ve talked about\u2014to the extent that the hospitals need more money because of the medical issues, we\u2019ll monitor that. We want to make sure there are incentives for restaurants, entertainment\u2014people to get back to those types of things. So we\u2019ll be looking at, very specifically, provisions to stimulate parts of the economy. Some of them may be money issues. Some of them may be regulatory issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, just to clarify your understanding of your authority vis-\u00e0-vis governors\u2014just to be very specific: For instance, if a governor issued a stay-at-home order \u2014<br />\r\nTHE PRESIDENT: When you say \u201cmy authority\u201d\u2014the President\u2019s authority. Not mine, because it\u2019s not me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: If I could just ask the question \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: This is\u2014when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s got to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It\u2019s total? Your authority is total?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s total. It\u2019s total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Your authority is total?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And the governors know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So if a governor \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: The governors know that. No, you have \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: If a governor issues a stay-at-home order, you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\u2014a couple of bands of\u2014excuse me. Excuse me. You have a couple \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Could you rescind that? Could you rescind that order?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What if it was a Republican governor?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: But the authority of the President of the United States, having to do with the subject we\u2019re talking about, is total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please, go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, one of the things you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: One of the things you\u2014one of the things you spoke\u2014we saw in your video about was the travel ban from Europe. As part of reopening America, do you want to reopen the borders so that people from Europe, from the UK \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: At the right time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: How soon do you think we are from \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And a very good question, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I\u2019m going to have to take a look. I wouldn\u2019t say Italy is doing great right now, and I wouldn\u2019t say Spain is doing great right now. And we just heard that France is extending its stay-inside order, right? Their stay\u2014they\u2019ve extended it\u2014I just see that\u2014and, I think, for a short period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But no, when they\u2019re back. We want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything is good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, right now we have a very \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Weeks, months?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Right now we have a very strong ban. We\u2019re going to keep it that way until they heal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Weeks, months? What would you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can\u2019t tell you that. I can\u2019t tell you that. I have to see: How are they doing? I mean, France just went for another two days\u2014for another two weeks. We have to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So Dr. Fauci said that you took his advice on the question of mitigation. He made the recommendation. You accepted it. You put into place. As you make this next decision, which, as you have said \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I\u2019m not sure who\u2014Jon, I\u2019m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: No, not on the ban. I\u2019m talking about the mitigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don\u2019t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014the social\u2014the social distancing, I\u2019m talking about. The shutting down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Not of travel, but of activity. So my question is: As you make this next decision, which you have said may be the most difficult or important decision of your presidency, will you assure the American people that you will again take the advice of the doctors\u2014of Dr. Fauci, of Dr. Birx? Will you take the advice of the health experts before you do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I will and many other people also. But I will absolutely take their advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But would you go against them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Please go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yes, Mr. \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Would you go against their recommendation? If they say you need another 15 or 30 days, would you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t think it would be likely because I think we\u2019re not very far from being on the same page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yes, Mr. President, one thing that Governor Cuomo said today is that states do not have the capacity to do the mass COVID-19 testing ahead of a reopening as \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, they have to do it. Look, they\u2019re supposed to be doing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: He says he can\u2019t purchase the diagnostic tests or equipment \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I know. I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014and needs federal help. So will the states get that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2014they may need help, but \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Will they get it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: But they\u2019re there. They\u2019re on ground. They\u2019ve got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But he needs the supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuilt tests. We\u2014we rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare, as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened, where they have such a great test as that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, in fact, what I\u2019ll do\u2014I think, unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of the Treasury\u2014do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. Secretary Mnuchin \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that for the Secretary of the Treasury or for me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: For Secretary Mnuchin, yeah. Yes, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Because if it\u2019s for me, we can wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It\u2019s for Secretary Mnuchin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We have to get him back to work, okay?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yes, sir. For Secretary Mnuchin, a question \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014from one of my colleagues who\u2019s not able to be in the room. They\u2019re curious about the SBA rule that prevents small casinos from getting some of this relief. Is that something that you\u2019re taking a look at? Is there going to be a change to the \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, no\u2014not small casinos, but there are such things as small taverns and restaurants that have literally, you know, small gaming things. And we are coming out with some additional guidance on that. But I want to be clear: It\u2019s not small casinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Secretary Mnuchin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Secretary?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: There was a letter that some House Republicans sent this weekend, about the liquidity for a mortgage servicers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Are\u2014can you explain what you\u2019re looking at on that front?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Sure. So I think I commented on this a week or so ago. We had a subcommittee task force at FSOC that specifically studied this issue. We have all the appropriate people on it. Ginnie Mae has automatically taken some action. We\u2019ve had conversations with the FHFA as to what they\u2019re going to do for Fannie and Freddie. And we\u2019ve said that to the extent they need certain authorities from the Treasury, we will accommodate that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re very aware of the issue. Quite frankly, we\u2019ve been studying this issue way before COVID and had concerns about some of these non-bank servicers not being well capitalized. But we\u2019re going to\u2014we\u2019re going to make sure that the market functions properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, sir. We have seen, in a number of these relief bills, that Democrats and Republicans have been able to push forward different non-coronavirus-specific funding priorities. Are you trying to keep funding specific to coronavirus? And then, if there are going to be other additions\u2014for instance, a change to labor rules is something that many on the left wanted. Some of the right are wondering if they should also\u2014if you should also be pushing for, you know, their preferred add-ons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, I think our expectation has always been this is COVID related. Some people have a rather broad view of what \u201cCOVID related\u201d is, because it has impacted almost every single business. I mean, I think, we\u2019ve\u2014the President has talked about the Kennedy Center, which is a good institution. Obviously, that was not the major priority in the bill, but they were hit with COVID related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So\u2014but, no, the President has instructed we want to be very specific in the next bill. It\u2019s COVID-related items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It\u2019s been reported \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we didn\u2019t want to do the Kennedy Center, just so you understand. And that that was done\u2014the Democrats wanted it in. We didn\u2019t want that, but they wanted it in. And we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. We\u2019re not looking for extraneous nonsense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: It\u2019s been reported that you argued, at the time the China ban was being discussed, that that was too disruptive to the global economy. Is that accurate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me be clear: I had nothing to do with the China ban. I wasn\u2019t on the task force at the time. I\u2019m not even sure I was\u2014I think I was traveling at the time. But I never had any\u2014I was not part\u2014I did become very active, and after the China ban, but that report in the New York Times was not accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You did not weigh in beforehand?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I was not part of the task force at that time, and I was\u2014I was not involved. As a matter of fact, I think I may have been traveling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Secretary Mnuchin, there\u2019s a proposal made by Senator Hawley to get direct payments to employers to pay people who have been laid off and to keep people on payroll. Does the administration support that proposal?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, again, that is the PPP. The PPP is basically sending money to small business\u201450 percent of American workers\u2014to keep those people paid. And it\u2019s the most efficient way. Every dollar, as I said, we do through that, it\u2019s one less dollar of unemployment. And more importantly, we want those people to have\u2014be associated with the business. So as soon as the President is ready to open up the economy, those businesses are together. We don\u2019t want those businesses to fall apart. That\u2019s why this is such a successful program, and we want Congress to put more money in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: But are you talking about unemployment? You\u2019re talking about the unemployment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: (Inaudible) Senator Hawley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Sending it indirectly to the states?&nbsp; We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And, you know, I\u2019ve talked to you about it: We have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems. They\u2019re run by the state. But I\u2019m hearing they\u2019re getting the money out anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, some\u2014some of them are, and some of the states aren\u2019t, and we encourage\u2014you know, we\u2019re working with the states to try to update their computers, but it\u2019s a\u2014it\u2019s a long haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? Thank you, Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Phase four, Steve. Phase four. Come on, Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: A quick question about something you just said. You said, \u201cWhen someone is President of the United States, their authority is total.\u201d That is not true. Who\u2014who told you that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So you know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to write up papers on this. It\u2019s not going to be necessary, because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately it comes with the federal government. That being said, we\u2019re getting along very well with the governors, and I feel very certain that there won\u2019t be a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Has any governor agreed that you have the authority to decide when their state opens back up?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I haven\u2019t asked anybody because I don\u2019t\u2014you know why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Because no one has\u2014no one has said that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Because I don\u2019t have to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go ahead, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But who told you the President has the total authority?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Enough. Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You mentioned the Vice President\u2019s call with the governors today. Governor Hogan of Maryland has urged your administration to ask Congress for $500 billion to help stabilize budgetary shortfalls created by coronavirus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019s nice of Governor Hogan, very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan\u2019s statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Governor Cuomo said the CARES Act ignored state government shortfalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Cuomo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Do you support that request?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Which one? What did he say?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: He said the CARES Act ignored the budgetary shortfalls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, they\u2019re looking at things in phase four, where they have\u2014you know, where they talk about states, and they\u2019re also talking about hospitals. They\u2019re talking about states who have been battered, and they\u2019re also talking about hospitals. And we\u2019re certainly willing to look at that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Will you urge Congress on their behalf?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, we\u2019ll see what we all come back with. But they are talking about states and they\u2019re talking about hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OAN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you, Mr. President. The Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, has on Thursday signed an executive order banning the sale of non-essential goods. If other states follow \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: The sale of what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Non-essential goods. She has banned the sale of non-essential goods. Many are calling this draconian, unconstitutional. As President, do you think that if other states were to follow her example in the coming weeks, that the federal government should intervene?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I think it\u2019s very extreme. But she\u2019s doing it, and I think it\u2019s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It\u2019s a very strong position to take. But they\u2019re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let\u2019s see how it all works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What is the status of the funding for the World Health Organization?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re going to be talking about that very soon. I\u2019m getting a full report. I\u2019m not happy with the World Health Organization. I\u2019m not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We\u2019ve been ripped off by everybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we have\u2014this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it\u2019s a World Health or World Trade. And they\u2019re like\u2014I call them the \u201cBobbsey Twins.\u201d They\u2019d look at our country\u2014for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We\u2019re doing a lot about it. So we\u2019ll have a report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019ll also\u2014we\u2019re also talking about the World Trade Organization. But we\u2019ve made a lot of progress there. We\u2019re now winning cases for the first time, because they know I\u2019ll leave if we don\u2019t get treated fairly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This country\u2014our country\u2014was at a point where we rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization. But now we\u2019re winning a lot of them, because they know I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit, which was very nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Do you expect a decision this week on cutting funding for the WHO?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Uh, yeah. I would say, by the end of the week, I\u2019m going to make a decision on that. Yeah. There\u2019s a lot of\u2014right now, there\u2019s a lot of things happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: On China\u2014why are there no consequences for China, for the misinformation that they shared?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: How do you know there are no consequences?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Because you\u2019ve said. Well, you\u2019ve been asked, and it appear that there were no \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: How do you know there are no consequences?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What are the consequences, Mr. President, for the misinformation \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn\u2019t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But people are concerned that they stonewalled, that they gave misinformation \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, you started off by saying, \u201cWhy are there no consequences?\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Because you\u2019ve been asked this a few times, so I\u2019m following up on your response. Why are there no consequences for China?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: How do you know there are no consequences?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Because we\u2019ve asked you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You\u2019re going to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: \u2014and you\u2019ve said\u2014you\u2019ve said that didn\u2019t want to have an consequences because you suggested trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn\u2019t tell you. You\u2019d probably be the last person on Earth I\u2019d tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So you\u2019re saying there will be consequences?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Uh, yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President\u2014actually, this is a question for Mr. Vice President. Do you agree with the President\u2019s statement and his understanding of federalism, that his power is total\u2014like in the way he described it? Is there anything you\u2019d like to add or any context you\u2019d like to add to the way he was discussing that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: I support the President\u2019s leadership under the national emergency declaration that he signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019re standing before you today, the first time in American history, when all 50 states have issued emergency declarations, and the territories. This is an unprecedented time in the life of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And fortunately, as the President has reflected and our health experts will continue to reflect, because the American people have heeded the President\u2019s Coronavirus Guidelines for America; because state governors have taken those and implemented them, even in states where there was not a significant outbreak; and implemented additional measures as we provided them with data about cases and best practices\u2014we\u2019re making real progress as a country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But it sounds like you think his power is a little bit more circumscribed than totally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, make no mistake about it: In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. And you can look back through times of war and other national emergencies. And as the President said, we\u2019ll happily brief that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the days ahead, what the President has charged us to do is to work with our health experts. We\u2019re going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to counsel the President. And then, working with the CDC, we\u2019re going to produce new guidelines, based upon the data, for every state and territory in this nation. We\u2019re going to give them guidance. And, as the President has indicated, we\u2019ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we forge with every governor in America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is an unprecedented time. But I have to tell you: When you look at the fact\u2014despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22,000 Americans\u2014when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps that President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, we were discussing today, at the task force, that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today. And that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work. But it\u2019s also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists, now more than a month ago, and our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I have to tell you that standing here today, I couldn\u2019t be more proud to stand alongside this President and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I just say to you: To every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you\u2019re saving lives and you\u2019re seeing our nation through this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sir, did the states tell you\u2014you\u2019ve been talking to the governors quite a bit\u2014did those coalitions of states on the West Coast and in the Northeast, did they tell you what they are going to be announcing before they announce it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Governor Phil Murphy and the governor of Connecticut expressed today that they were going to be speaking on a\u2014and discussing on a regional basis what their recommendations would be. And we assured them today \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Did they alert the White House about that, though, sir?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: We assured them today on our conference call with, I think, 48 governors that were with us today for the better part of an hour and a half\u2014we told them that what the President would be producing\u2014has directed to be produced are additional guidelines for the states, certified by the CDC, that would inform those governors and local communities and mayors about the best way forward, based on the unique circumstances that those states and those communities are facing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think what\u2019s clear is the American people have seen the experience in Washington State, where this really all began for us; and in California; and now, the extraordinary challenges in the Greater New York City area, including New Jersey and Connecticut; the challenges in New Orleans and Louisiana and Detroit, still Chicago, parts of Houston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they\u2019re also seeing that, in each one of those cases, that the mitigation efforts are truly working. And so we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll work with those\u2014we\u2019ll work with those states. And in some cases, it\u2019ll make perfect sense for them to work together on a regional basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Any idea why they didn\u2019t let you know ahead of time what they were planning?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you don\u2019t know that. You don\u2019t know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: But\u2014but the President\u2014the President will be \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: (Inaudible.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t know that. I\u2019m sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, can you tell us? Did they let you know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t know that. No, you made a statement. You don\u2019t know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: I didn\u2019t hear your\u2014I didn\u2019t hear your statement. I\u2019m sorry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And we would\u2014and we would like to have their cooperation. And we are going to have their cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: I\u2014and let me just affirm what the President said. We heard it again today in what I think was our ninth conference call with governors is: I think every American would be proud to see the partnership that this President has forged with governors across the country. I mean, it is an extraordinary statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And you\u2019ll see some data when Admiral Polowczyk gets up in just a few moments, but the flow of resources from around the world that we\u2019ve moved into areas that have faced challenges\u2014I mean, this President has directed us to ensure that every state has what they need, when they need it. And the spirit that I heard again from Republicans and Democrat governors today was reflective of that partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as we move forward to the President\u2019s goal of reopening America, we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: All right, go ahead, with the face mask. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sir, if you can hear me through the mask \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Barely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Can\u2014can you \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I hear you well, actually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014the\u2014the District of Columbia argues that they were shortchanged in the most recent funding bill because they were treated as a territory instead of as a state. Will that be made right in phase four?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we\u2019ve done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: She was on today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I mean, she\u2019s actually\u2014and she was on today, saying very good things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President, you talked about this being the most difficult decision that you are going to have to take about whether to reopen the economy. I wonder how much it weighs on your mind the thought that if there is a second wave, you\u2019ve reopened the economy and you might have to shut things down again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: It does. And I hope that won\u2019t happen. I certainly hope that won\u2019t happen, but it does weigh on my mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, in the back, go ahead. You had one. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. President?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you. Okay, thank you. A question for one of my colleagues who wasn\u2019t able to be here. China deployed an aircraft carrier into the South China Chi [sic]\u2014South China Sea this weekend, amid claims by Chinese state media that COVID has reduced U.S. military readiness in the region. What kind of responses are you thinking of? Will you have a response to this action?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that\u2014we\u2019re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I\u2019ve been very explicit on that. But we know all about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, no, China is\u2014we\u2019ve seen what they did. We\u2019ve seen many other things that they\u2019ve done, both pro and con. And we\u2019ll be just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: On Abbott, you said something earlier, where you said that you\u2019re putting together the economic task force and that you thought that the recommendations were happening earlier than expected. Did you mean to suggest that it could be before May 1st that you start recommending that states open?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I don\u2019t want to say that, but we\u2019re going to be putting out guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly. In a few days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You\u2019re not ruling out that it would be before?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m not going to say. But, look, certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They\u2019re doing, really, very well. And so we\u2019re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And would these new guidelines be\u2014would they fit each area or would they be a uniform set of guidelines?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you\u2019re going to see. I\u2014I don\u2019t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know, pretty much\u2014we have some good ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also do want to get\u2014I want to have\u2014we\u2019ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people, having to do with certain fields, whether it\u2019s energy or whether it\u2019s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do. Whether it\u2019s deductibility or not, we\u2019ll see, but it should be deductibility. You\u2019ll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductibility. The restaurant business, it\u2014it was one of the hot businesses. And then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago. But we may need that to get people back into the restaurants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah. Michelle Obama, today, got behind mail-in voting nationwide as a possible solution to the\u2014on states. She said it shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. Have your advisors told you that that could save lives? And (inaudible)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Absentee ballot, are you talking about? Absentee ballot?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah, and on a massive scale because of the coronavirus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t know what she did. I mean, I didn\u2019t see that. When did that happen? Today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah, she\u2019s part of\u2014that\u2019s a nonpartisan group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I wish her luck. I wish her a lot of luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please, go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: On Abbott Labs, you said you had long \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yes, Mr. President. There\u2019s a little bit of confusion about your phone calls yesterday with President Putin. The Kremlin is saying that you discussed current issues of ensuring strategic security. That wasn\u2019t referred to in the White House<br />\r\nreadout. Can you enlighten us \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: We discussed many things. We did discuss China. We discussed many different things, but we\u2014it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine. And they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels. I think the number is going to be closer to 20\u2014maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10. And I think it was a very important call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia and that was a very important call. And the bottom nine is OPEC Plus. It\u2019s called OPEC Plus because there are other states also, other nations. We came to a very good agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: You have \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What was the part about strategic security? Was that \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I would say mostly we were talking about China. We were talking about their borders. And we\u2019re talking about our borders a little bit\u2014our borders with Mexico. Because, as you know, Mexico is a big part of the deal. And Mexico really\u2014it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico. It was not an easy deal for Mexico. And the President\u2014we appreciated a certain amount of flexibility. But we talked about borders, we talked about China, we talked about Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But \u201cstrategic security\u201d sounds more like arms treaties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I mean, I\u2014we did talk about the arms. Yes, we did. That was a very important part of the call actually. Yeah, good point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So, on Abbott Labs, you said testing is going great. We know that they have\u2014these machines have been sent to some of the governors, but some of them are saying they don\u2019t have the materials to actually conduct the tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, they have to get the material. You know, the governors have to get the material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The cartridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Now, if they can\u2019t get it, they\u2019re going to see us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The government is\u2014the federal government is distributing those cartridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m talking about the local governments. I\u2019m talking about governors have to get the material. Now, they have machines. In fact, we\u2014we\u2019re going to go into\u2014I\u2019d ask Mike to go into it as soon as I leave. They have very powerful machines that they don\u2019t know they even have. I\u2019m not talking about Abbott; I\u2019m talking about the governors. They have machines that are used for this \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: The hospital labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You know what I\u2019m talk-\u2014do you know what I\u2019m referring to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Yeah, they have the two different machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Very big, very powerful machines where, in a certain state\u2019s case, they\u2019re only using 10 percent of their capacity and they didn\u2019t know it. That happens to be Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jon, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Okay, well, real quick. Real quick. These 15-minute tests that you\u2019ve sent out, these new ones that you had in the Rose Garden, they say\u2014including Governor Sununu in New Hampshire\u2014that they don\u2019t have the cartridges to actually conduct the test. So when will they get those cartridges?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: What do you think the answer to that is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re rapidly\u2014we\u2019re rapidly increasing the numbers, Mr. President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Rapidly increasing the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: And Deb will speak to (inaudible).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Can we look into when?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Rapidly increases. Well, pretty quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: They can\u2014they can do 50,000 a day, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have other machines where they can really work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Can they go up beyond that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And a lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot. They didn\u2019t even know they had them. They didn\u2019t even know that they had them. And Mike is going to be talking about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And you remember you mentioned, several weeks ago, the\u2014that Google was putting together that website<br />\r\nwhere they would handle the drive-through testing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Google and Apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Have you\u2014have you given up on \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: You mean Google and Apple combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Have you\u2014have you moved past that, because you said \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No. A lot of people don\u2019t like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights. I mean, a lot of people don\u2019t like it and some people think it\u2019s great. No, they are working on that, as I understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: How about the testing website? Remember you said a website for Google and \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, no, I know that. I know that. I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And it\u2019s only operating in, I think, five counties in California right now. Is that \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s right. No, Google is looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple or looking at something. We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we\u2019re looking at now is going to be obsolete. That\u2019s how good it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have things happening that are unbelievable. I saw a presentation today that I can\u2019t talk about yet, but it\u2019s incredible. Plus, I think they\u2019re doing\u2014Tony\u2014I think they\u2019re doing very well in the vaccines. They\u2019re working hard on the vaccines and I think you\u2019ll have an answer for vaccines. I believe that there\u2019s some great things coming out with respect to that. Now you need a testing period, but you\u2019re going to have some great things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sir, on the contact tracing that Google and Apple are doing\u2014so a different subject, on the contact \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, no. This is\u2014this is the Google and Apple. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a partnership or what, but they\u2019re working on some \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Correct. So there was the one \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: They\u2019re working on more than one element. They\u2019re working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple. Google is also working on something, as you know, having to do with testing. I believe they\u2019re doing that in a singular fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So my question is not about the drive-through testing website. Not that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: On Google and Apple\u2019s contact tracing that they want to \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014they\u2019ve got this process now where they can put, you know, contact tracing on your phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: If you opt in, you can be alerted if you\u2019ve been \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014in contact with someone with the coronavirus. Do you\u2014how do you feel about that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it. You know that. It\u2019s an amazing thing and it would be\u2014actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar but not as good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Which other countries are thinking about something similar?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: I hear Singapore is. Singapore is. No, Singapore had a little bit of a setback because they had a \u2013they had a break. You know that, and\u2014but they\u2019ll take care of it. I know\u2014I know the folks in Singapore. They\u2019re doing a great job and they\u2019re going to put it back very quickly. But Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Would you prefer that Americans use some other system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don\u2019t want to get into that because we have a whole constitutional thing. We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: A testing question, maybe for Dr. Fauci as well. Can you talk about where the antibody test is and how quickly that will be (inaudible)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s moving along. I think I can speak because I\u2014I have to leave. Moving along quickly, moving along well. It\u2019s a test that\u2019s been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it. But that\u2019s moving on. The antibody test have\u2014moving along very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, anymore COVID-19? COVID-19?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: One soldier on the Theodore Roosevelt has died. Has\u2014have you determined the status of Captain Crozier, the former commander?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, that\u2019s going through the Navy, as I understand it. The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that. And they had a break in\u2014I don\u2019t think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic, to be honest with you. You know, I don\u2019t think the captain should have been writing letters. He\u2019s not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn\u2019t have been writing letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I don\u2019t think\u2014I don\u2019t know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam. But they stopped in Vietnam and all of a sudden they get on, and now you have over 500 sailors and\u2014and people on the ship that are affected. I don\u2019t know whose idea that was, but that wasn\u2019t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, please. Jon. Go ahead, Jon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Just one last\u2014on this question of constitutionality, I\u2019m just wondering what changed your view because \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Nothing changed it. No, no, I know exactly what you\u2019re going to say. Nothing changed it. The fact that I want to rely on states or maybe will or maybe have, and the fact that we\u2019ve gotten on\u2014that\u2019s one thing. The fact that I don\u2019t want to use the power is another thing. Look \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But you said from the standpoint of the Constitution \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014you thought it should be up to the governors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Constitutionally. You can look at constitutionally. You can look at federalism. You can look at it any different way. Jon, the fact that I don\u2019t want to exert my power is much different. We have the power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You asked, \u201cDoes the federal government have the power?\u201d The federal government has absolute power. It has the power. As to whether or not I\u2019ll use that power, we\u2019ll see. I would rather \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So if New York wants to stay closed down, you can \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Jon, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government. That\u2019s why with\u2014I guess it\u2019s now seven states not eight that\u2014because South Carolina did\u2014you know, they went away from what we discussed the last time. So that\u2019s why I looked at the individual states; they\u2019re doing a very good job. They\u2019re really doing a very good job. I\u2019d rather have them make the decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the fact that I\u2019d rather have\u2014that\u2019s fine. But I have the absolute right to do if I want to. I may not want to. We have a very good relationship. Now, we\u2019ll see what happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you notice, the few states you\u2019re talking about, they\u2019re all with Democrat governors. But if governors are doing a good job and they control it better\u2014because you don\u2019t have somebody in Washington saying, \u201cSet up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.\u201d And we\u2019re in Washington and they\u2019re in a state that\u2019s very far away. That\u2019s really\u2014it should be and it should have always been. And I\u2019ve always said it was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good. And we\u2019ll be announcing, over the next very short period of time, exactly what we\u2019re going to be doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, a couple of more. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: On coronavirus and Joe Biden: He\u2019s the presumptive Democratic nominee. Do you have any plans yet on when you\u2019ll start sharing, or when the White House will start sharing some of that information about the coronavirus? Your presidential daily brief?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, nobody has called about coronavirus, about\u2014from their standpoint. Look, they had the H1N1, which is swine flu, and that was a big failure. That was a tremendous failure. They had a lot of failures. And you take a look at what\u2014you take a look at the history. And, you know, 17,000 people died. And you talk about late? They were so late\u2014they were late like it never even existed. That was a\u2014that was a big problem. Caused a lot of other people a big problem too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, you know, if Joe Biden would like a briefing, I\u2019d certainly get him a briefing. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So, are Jared and Ivanka on\u2014serving on the new task force? And how are you going to balance \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No, they\u2019re not. No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Yes, go ahead, please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I just want to clarify. So, in earlier conversation, there was a description of multiple different councils or tasks\u2014task forces. Can you just explain exactly what the structure is and who is going to be on it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have Mike\u2019s task force, which is the White House Task Force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say. Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through. And I was on many of those calls. And every call got better and better and better. It was hostile at the beginning. By the time we finished\u2014I mean, today\u2019s call was a very good call, a very friendly call. I think everyone is online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And again, you don\u2019t have anybody driving you crazy, saying they\u2019re not getting ventilators, they\u2019re not getting all of the different things, they need more beds. They have a lot of beds right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: (Inaudible) hospitals who\u2014doctors who say they don\u2019t have the supplies that they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And we always err\u2014and I think it\u2019s important for you know\u2014we always erred on the sake of \u201cGive them more.\u201d Even when we didn\u2019t think\u2014we didn\u2019t think New York needed the beds that they were asking for. We didn\u2019t think they needed the ventilators that they asked for. And we were right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, on ventilators, we\u2019re ready to march. I told you this: We\u2019re ready to march. We have 10,000 ventilators. We\u2019re ready to move them anywhere in the country when we need them, if we need them. We\u2019re also building a lot of ventilators, and that\u2019s going to be used at some point, I believe. You know we\u2019re going to have stockpiles, including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us. But we\u2019re also going to help other countries, whether it\u2019s Italy, or Spain, or other\u2014France is having a big problem. They all desperately need\u2014Germany too\u2014they need ventilators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we\u2019re going to have a lot of ventilators. We have a lot\u2014you heard the numbers\u2014we have a lot coming next week. Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, final question. Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And on the task force\u2014I\u2019d asked for the task\u2014how the task force is going to be structured. Is it one \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: No. Then we have\u2014in addition to that, we have a number of committees. We\u2019ll have a transportation committee. We\u2019re going to have a manufacturing committee. You\u2019ll see it tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re also having a religious leaders committee. We have a great group of religious leaders. We\u2019re having committees with religious leaders. You\u2019ve been seeing what\u2019s going on with the churches, and all of that. And we\u2019re going to have a faith leaders committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so we have\u2014we\u2019re going to have a few committees. I\u2019ll call them \u201ccommittees,\u201d and then ultimately we\u2019re going to make decisions. So we\u2019re going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they\u2019re going to be the correct decision. I hope so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So you form the economic task force tomorrow. When do you want them to have recommendations for you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Soon. Soon. And they already know what I want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Next week or \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, when we form\u2014when you say \u201cform,\u201d I don\u2019t have to give them instructions. These are very sophisticated people. These are the best people in their fields. So I don\u2019t have to say, \u201cGee, let\u2019s\u2014we just met and we\u2019re going to meet in two weeks and here\u2019s what we\u2019re\u2026\u201d I said, \u201cHere\u2019s what I want.\u201d We\u2019ve already told them. And they\u2019re the \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: What did you tell them you want?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\u2014the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions. I mean, they\u2019re\u2014these are the greatest names. The people that, I think, probably know the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we\u2019ve called them and we\u2019re going to be speaking to them very soon. And we want them to have\u2014if it\u2019s questions, or statements, we want them to have that for us. And we will have either a response, or maybe\u2014I mean, ideally we\u2019re going to be learning from them. And we\u2019ll be able to do that and put them\u2014put everything we learned from those calls into our new guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we\u2019re going to have new guidelines coming soon. I think it\u2019s going to be very good. I think it\u2019s going to be very smooth. And I hope it\u2019s going to be very safe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Any thoughts on Stanley Chera, sir? Any thoughts on Stanley Chera \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PRESIDENT: Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time. He\u2019s a great real estate person\u2014passed away. Was a great real estate person. Great. Great. Sort of a legend in New York real estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He called me a couple of weeks ago, said he tested positive. Stanley is in his early- to mid-80s, I guess. And Stanley went to the hospital and he never came out. He went into a coma. He was unconscious for a long period of time and he never made it. A great man. He left\u2014very charitable, really a great philanthropist. A very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business. So I got to know him a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States. He was like\u2014like a young boy. And he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy. He was so excited. He thought we\u2019d do such a good job and he was so happy. And he\u2014he was very proud of what we\u2019ve done in this administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But he was tested positive, and unfortunately he\u2014he didn\u2019t make it. It\u2019s a very\u2014to me, it\u2019s a very sad thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you all very much. Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. As the President mentioned, the task force today spoke to 48 of the nation\u2019s governors. On that call, we reflected on the fact that all\u2014all 50 states had emergency declarations in place, which was a first for American history; $5.2 billion had been distributed to the states under the Stafford Act. And it was a productive call and reflective of President Trump\u2019s ongoing direction for us to work closely with the states to make sure the states in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus have what they need, when they need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke about the issue of testing and supplies. And I\u2019m going to ask Dr. Deborah Birx to come forward, as well as Admiral Polowczyk, to reflect on both of those topics for you. Dr. Birx has been leading an effort from the task force from early on, on rapidly expanding testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was early on that the President formed that public-private partnership with commercial labs. And as we stand here today, more than 2.5 million tests have been performed. And when we add in the estimates of labs that we have to assume, with reasonable protections\u2014projections have not yet reported into the CDC, we think that number could be closer to 3 million tests that have been performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As has been mentioned, the new 15-minute test, we are\u2014we are working closely with Abbott Laboratories\u2014that the President and our team met with today here at the White House\u2014to rapidly increase the availability of cartridges. Abbott is producing roughly 50,000 cartridges a day. FEMA acquired an initial supply of that and distributed those to the states, but we\u2019re working with the states to not only distribute what\u2019s being made, but also work with other suppliers to create additional cartridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A point that I\u2019ll ask Dr. Birx to expand on in just a moment is the fact that\u2014beyond the new 15-minute test by Abbott Laboratories; beyond what we expect to be a new antibody test, which may well be approved by the FDA in just a matter of days; and an antibody test that would be produced at the rate of 20 million tests a month\u2014the reality is that those commercial laboratories that the President brought in here, the better part of two months ago, and initiated that public- and private-partnership with have been producing hundreds of thousands of tests every single week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as Dr. Birx and our team have apprehended, we believe, at this point in time, that of the Roche equipment that is out there that does the high-speed testing\u2014and we informed governors of this today\u2014we think that that some 20 percent of that capacity is not being used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And with regard to the Abbott m2000 systems, we told the governors today that we think 75 percent of that laboratory capacity that exists in the United States today is not being utilized by our governors. So we sent a very clear message to governors today to reach out to their hospitals, reach out to their labs to identify the presence of the Roche Amplicor 500 and the Abbott m2000 to get those activated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We literally estimate that, although we\u2019re doing over 110,000 tests a day in the United States, that if our\u2014if our governors and state labs would simply activate the machines that are already there, we could double the amount of testing in the United States literally overnight. And so, I know that governors\u2019 teams watch these briefings, and we\u2019ll remind them very respectfully again to identify those labs. And we have a\u2014we have a team that now is deploying, reaching out to labs to see if we can activate all of those labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, on the subject of supplies\u2014I\u2019ve said it a couple of times from this podium today, but let me say it one more time: President Trump\u2019s direction to us, in dealing with the states on personal protective equipment and ventilators, has been to make sure that states have what they need, when they need it. And we recognize that while we all watch the overall curve of the coronavirus in America\u2014understandably, the national numbers\u2014the reality is this outbreak has taken place in its own individual curves: first, on the West Coast; then the New York City area; then Louisiana, Michigan; and now we continue to contend with it in Chicago and Houston and other metropolitan areas. It has given us the opportunity to ensure that personal protective equipment and ventilators are made available on a critical basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I have to tell you: We\u2019re incredibly proud of the effort and the partnership with states that has us standing here today that no one who has required a ventilator has been denied a ventilator in the United States of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, we have just short of 7,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile. But as\u2014as Admiral Polowczyk will detail, we\u2019re already beginning to receive newly manufactured ventilators. We\u2019ll get another thousand in this week. By the middle of May, we\u2019ll literally have another 8,000 ventilators available for deployment around the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m going to let him describe to you the specific detailing of those resources. But\u2014but I want to\u2014I want to share these numbers, most especially for our healthcare workers around the country in the areas most impacted by the coronavirus, so that you know the resources are surging into the hospital systems at the point of the need, and we will continue to do just that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let me recognize Dr. Birx to reflect on the data and also on, maybe, some comments on testing. And then Admiral Polowczyk, if you can step up and then you\u2019ll describe the supplies. We\u2019ll hear from Dr. Fauci again, and then take a few questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. BIRX: Great. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I don\u2019t know if we can get the first slide on cumulative cases? Yes, thank you so much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wanted to show you a different way of looking at it today. Obviously, we look at case counts per 100,000 Americans in each of our states and metro areas, but I wanted you to see, in absolute numbers, how much the New York, New Jersey metro area dwarfs all other metro areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so you can\u2019t even see Chicago, Detroit, or Boston. All of those metro areas are under 25,000 cases. You can see that the New York, New Jersey metro area is about almost 250,000 when you bring those cases together\u2014almost a log more. And that\u2019s why you hear us talking a lot about the metro area of New York and New Jersey; and the counties of Rockland and Westchester and Suffolk and Nassau and Bergen, New Jersey; and why we\u2019re so focused on getting resources to that metro area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I could see the next slide, then. So if I take New York and New Jersey metro area out, this is the other metro areas that we have been tracking very closely. I wanted to show this to you so that you could see how those curves are already starting to plateau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you look at Detroit, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Louisiana\u2014Louisiana is in green. Detroit is in gray. You can see across the board, across these metro areas\u2014across metro areas with\u2014have a higher concentration of individuals, this is what the American people in these large cities have done, where it is more difficult often to socially distance. And we\u2019re just really impressed by the work of the mayors and the governors to make this happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also wanted you to see this because you can clearly see Chicago and Boston. And so, Chicago is in the orange and Boston is in the yellow. They are crossing Detroit. And that\u2019s why we have been very much focused on the needs of those areas. And there is one\u2014and Providence is also in that category. It\u2019s difficult for them to\u2014for you to see you them because they\u2019re much further down on the slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the highest\u2014if you look at the axis on this slide\u2014it\u2019s 25,000. The axis on the last slide was 300,000. And so that\u2019s why I really want people to understand each of these epidemics, minor\u2014these small epidemics in each of the metro areas\u2014we\u2019re tracking independently, as well as any epidemics and outbreaks that are happening in some of our other states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I just wanted you to have that perspective of how significant the New York, New Jersey issue is and why we\u2019ve been tracking that so closely. But I also wanted to assure all of the other states that we\u2019re tracking them also very closely and really working with the governors and mayors and across\u2014and that\u2019s why I wanted you to see that not only are the curves flattening in some of those major metropolitan areas, but they\u2019re starting to decrease. And this is what we\u2019re very excited about. These are cases. We also know that mortality will lag. And so we\u2019re really tracking also the number of individuals who have succumbed to the COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also wanted to really note here that, yes, our mortality is less when you combine European countries equal to the size of the United States. And I think this is really two things: One, it\u2019s the incredible work of the American people, that it\u2019s also the incredible work of our healthcare providers, and the system of each of these hospitals that have the resources and the ability to respond to the needs of the COVID-19 patients. And I think you can really see the superb healthcare delivery that is happening by the low mortality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to mention really quickly about testing\u2014because you\u2019ve heard me before talk about it, and then it was a little bit misquoted and misaligned\u2014but there are multiple Abbott machines, so I\u2019m going to be very clear, having spent years in the laboratory. The high-throughput machines, which are the Roche 6800 and the 88-\u2014I think it\u2019s the 8800 on Roche\u2014and the Abbott M2000\u2014these are the machines that run between 500 and 1,000 assays at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Abbott company worked really hard, three weeks ago, in getting a million tests out there to be utilized. And they can make a million tests a week for all of our laboratories that have these platforms. And, so far, to date, somewhere around 250,000 tests have been utilized in three weeks\u2019 worth of work. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been appealing to the\u2014to the laboratory directors to really bring all those machines on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, Dr. Fauci and his incredible team of researchers have agreed to really reach out and find additional Roche and Abbott high-throughput machines that are in research institutions and doing critical research work, to bring them online also to supplement the other laboratories\u2019 work, to create a mosaic and a complete strategy that brings together the high-throughput platforms, with the medium-throughput platforms, with what are the low-throughput but rapid platforms\u2014which is this ID NOW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ID NOW is not going to be the answer to the number of tests that we need over the next few weeks. Those run a test every 15 minutes, and we can get about 55,000 cartridges a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I just got done saying that these other machines\u2014of which we have hundreds of\u2014can run 500 to 1,000 in a single timeframe. And so we need to bring all of these assays together. And a team has been created to call every single laboratory and every single research institution across the United States to define the complete capacity in every single state. Because it shouldn\u2019t be our expectation that every governor understands exactly everything that\u2019s in his state, but we have to understand everything in every state in order to be able to meet the needs of the American people as we increase testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I know you all know that, in three weeks, we went from 300,000 tests total to 3 million tests total, in three weeks. We know that we have to further increase that. That has been done really by HHS and Admiral Giroir and the team up there. And we\u2019re going to supplement that team to really bring on all of the additional resources and platforms that we have in the United States of America, just like we did with ventilators to bring all of the capacity to bear so that we can also continue to increase testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, of course as these epidemics are si-\u2014decrease, you can also be able to use more and more testing for surveillance. But I do want to call out the 19 states that aren\u2019t ever represented in these graphics in\u2014by and large. The states have been continuing to do containment and outbreak investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I\u2019ve been able to talk to many of those states. And I just remind all of us, when I talked to each one of these state health officials, where they are finding outbreaks are in nursing homes. And so we really knew to\u2014need to continue to protect and we continue to test in nursing homes, because we know that that\u2019s a particularly vulnerable group and it\u2019s a group we\u2019re often\u2014now that we\u2019re beginning to understand asymptomatic transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one is intending to pass the virus on to others, but we know, in essential workers around the United States, people are unknowingly infected and then passing the virus on. And so those are the ones that were very interested in finding. And you might say, \u201cWell, how do you find them because they don\u2019t have symptoms?\u201d And so this is where we really have to increase surveillance in a very deliberative and understand way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so we\u2019re really looking what are sentinel surveillance sites. I think we can see where there\u2019s outbreaks, because once people have symptoms, you can see them. But where do you do sentinel surveillance so that you find them before they have symptoms. This is what we have done for decades in HIV, and it\u2019s what\u2019s allowing us right now to really control the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, because we\u2019re finding people when they\u2019re asymptomatic and treating them when they\u2019re asymptomatic. So this is something we know how to do and it\u2019s something we\u2019re working very closely with CDC and others on to make sure that we can bring that full capacity to the American people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So these are just some insights and what we\u2019re working on. We\u2019re continuing, obviously, to track every single county and community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, finally, I\u2019m going to call on one additional group. There\u2019s a group out there of our HIV/AIDS activists and community workers that understand these tests that I\u2019ve been talking about, these DNA\u2014these RNA-based tests. Because they often get viral loads in HIV. But they will know how to explain this to the community, about sampling and what it means to run those assays. They are essentially virologists. They understand all of these assays. They also understand the antibody assays, because it\u2019s the antibody assays that they counsel and utilize in HIV testing across the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And maybe it will be our translator to the American public and to their local mayors. They understand these tests. They\u2019re\u2014essentially understand all the virology and all the immunology. And I\u2019m really asking all of them to help us communicate what these tests are so the community is ready for them. Because antibody tests measure something very different than the viral load in the front of your nose that we\u2019re using for diagnosis. And so, really being able to understand all of those tests, when to use them, how to use them will be really critical. But the great thing is, in the United States of America, we have these community groups that understand these tests very well, and we\u2019ll be able to discuss them at every level with their community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m going to call Admiral Polowczyk up in a minute, but I have to call on Dr. Tony Fauci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me\u2014let me\u2014let me just say something really straight from my heart, if I can. I lost my dad 32 years ago today. April 13th is always a tough day for our family. And this morning, when my brothers and sisters were sending around pictures of dad, like we always do, I just thought of the families of the more than 22,000 Americans that we\u2019ve lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I just want to tell you that you\u2019re on our hearts, and you\u2019re in the prayers of millions of Americans as you\u2014as you deal with this heartbreaking loss, as well as families that have family members that are struggling with serious illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let me just encourage everyone that, in the midst of that loss, because the American people have been putting these mitigation measures into practice, there are families that are still together today. And I just want to encourage you here at roughly the halfway point of \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread,\u201d to take\u2014take that to heart. In no way minimize the losses that we\u2019ve experienced as a nation and as families, but\u2014but to be encouraged to know, when you see those numbers on the vast majority of states, that because of what the American people are doing, it\u2019s working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, and the entire team, continually asked us to remind the American people, and we do so again today: Keep doing what you\u2019re doing with the \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread,\u201d and we will hasten the day that we heal our land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Fauci?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: I just want to make one comment that related to a question that was asked, and then we\u2019ll have questions. I don\u2019t want to take too much time. The idea about how we would evaluate, from a purely public health standpoint, about what I call reentry into some sort of normality. As health people, I don\u2019t know anything about, nor do I ever claim to know anything about, economics. There are going to be people that know a lot more than I do, who are going to give advice about all of the committees that the President was talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the one thing we do know as health people, as physicians and scientists and public health people\u2014as I mentioned, I think over the weekend, on one of the shows, is that some people may think it\u2019s going to be like a light switch, on and off. You know, we\u2019re either out and we\u2019re in. It\u2019s just not going to be that way because we have a very large country and there are different impacts. As you see, New York is very different from other parts of the country, from the Midwest, from the mountain region, California and Washington, different than New Orleans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So as we discuss and consider the public health aspects, it likely would be something that I refer to as sort of like a rolling reentry. It\u2019s not going to be one size fits all. So I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be yet because we still have time to look at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Birx, who does an amazing job with showing you the data and the charts\u2014that\u2019s going to likely influence some of the recommendations that we will make. But I can assure you there will be recommendations that will be based purely on public health. And the President will get a lot of other input from others, but we\u2019ll give the honest, public health recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Tony. Admiral? Admiral Polowczyk will give an update on supplies and then we\u2019ll take a few questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Can I have the ventilator slide back up? I\u2019ll just start from there. All right, thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you start with what\u2019s in the stockpile this morning. And then here\u2019s the contracts that we\u2019ll be delivering over the next few weeks. And we added 8,600 ventilators to the pool we already had. That\u2019s the\u2014that\u2019s the math that you\u2014that you get there. That\u2019s a\u2014that\u2019s included the DPA action with GM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019ll say that we\u2019ve also issued what would be called \u201crated orders\u201d with all of these vendors to allow them front-of-the-line privileges, so to speak, with\u2014within their supply chain. So these\u2014there\u2019s\u2014we\u2019ve, you know, written the contract. This is the 100,000-plus ventilators we\u2019re talking about, and then continue to work with them to ensure that the ventilators actually show up. So there\u2019s a continue to work there. And as we did that, we realized that downstream supply chains needed some additional Defense Production Act work as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you go out to the air bridge\u201480 flights scheduled, 37 complete, 43 on the\u2014on the horizon. And you can see the numbers of material that\u2019s been brought in to supplement the volume that\u2019s needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I\u2019m going to go through a series of slides of New York first. So, Dr. Birx provides me what I will call as a geographic reference to align the supply chain. So all of those cities\u2014you\u2019ll see a little bit of a theme here. I\u2019ll be talking about a lot of the\u2014a lot of the cities and geographic areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I aligned the supply chain to those geographic areas to try to get as much there, while we realize the rest of the nation needs supplies as well. And then we aligned to the supply chain to site of care: public hospitals, VA, private hospitals, nursing homes, first responders, acute care, and on down the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the last business week\u2014so, Monday of last week through Friday, Saturday of the past week\u2014these are the mass materials that came into the New York, New Jersey metro area, and you can see the volumes there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you go to Detroit, we talked about their hotspot. Here\u2019s the volumes of deliveries going into Detroit for that same time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can go to Chicago. And I\u2019m going to run through this kind of quick, but you can see that the geographic alignment, the places that Dr. Birx has talked about is where we\u2019re concentrating supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can go to New Orleans, to give you an understanding. Washington D.C., right? So now I can talk about that. Today was a\u2014you know, a very, kind of, early entry into the Washington, D.C., Baltimore\u2014right?\u2014positioning supplies ahead of need, we hope, in Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to Baltimore, and you can see trying to\u2014the volumes there, trying to get ahead of that. And then Philadelphia is next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then now the next slide is a nine-city roll-up. And so to save a little time, I did not include Boston and Houston in there. So you can see the volume of material flowing through a commercial network air bridge, their supplies, into geographic regions and then\u2014and then further prioritize to site of care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, final topic: N95 masks. So the Department of Defense announced a DPA action this weekend. That came over from DOD on Friday, into the White House, approved on Saturday. And contract awarded today $131 million, five companies: 3M, Honeywell, Owens &amp; Minor, Moldex, and Draeger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know, the CARES Act was signed before the\u2014before March was end\u2014towards the end there. So essentially two weeks from that money being put into the Title III authority for DOD. This action takes us from a baseline of what\u2014what was being produced domestically of about 30 million masks upwards to, as we go through the fall into the end of the winter, 120 million masks domestically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, currently, we\u2019re filling some of that demand from overseas sources. Right? And so the additive masks here, through this, will ramp up, lower dependence on overseas sources, and that\u2014that will essentially secure a big piece of the supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five companies, six\u2014six cities: Smithfield, Rhode Island; Phoenix, Arizona; Del Rio, Texas; Lexington, North Carolina; Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin; and Aberdeen, North Dakota\u2014all either producing more fabric or increasing production facilities to have that ramp up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Great. Great job. Thank you, Admiral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And can we put that slide\u2014I guess it\u2019s still up. This is for just the week ending April 11. We have distributed or directed the distribution of 5.3 million N95 masks, 5.5 million surgical masks, 110 million gloves. We shared that mostly just to make sure our healthcare workers know that the resources are flowing, we\u2019re going to continue to flow them, but this is just the numbers for this week and don\u2019t include, for instance, what the President announced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was able to tell Governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania today that, next week, they\u2019ll be receiving 2 million N95 masks to support some of the healthcare challenges that they\u2019re facing in the broader Philadelphia area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take a couple of questions. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Thank you so much. One for the Admiral and then one for Dr. Fauci, if you don\u2019t mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:&nbsp;Admiral, wouldn\u2019t it have been useful, as you\u2019re going through, you know, all of those supplies that are now making their way into the system\u2014you talked about having to buy foreign products, you know, as we\u2019re catching up and making it\u2014wouldn\u2019t it have been useful if it hadn\u2019t taken until mid-March for the government to start placing bulk orders for these kinds of supplies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK: Okay so, I came over from the Pentagon the 20th of March, so I\u2019ll speak from the 20th March on now. We\u2019re using the Defense Production Act. I think you\u2019ll see much more use of that as we go forward. You know, we make \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Sir, but my question is about the timing here and that lost time that the President earlier today denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REAR ADMIRAL POLOWCZYK: I know. And I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not equipped to talk about\u2014other than from about the 20th of March forward. I just\u2014I wasn\u2019t\u2014I was over at the Joint Staff. I wasn\u2019t involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: And I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fauci.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q:\u2014you know, you said that you\u2019d be, you know, giving the President your recommendations, you and Dr. Birx, coming up with a plan that you guys are comfortable with. Are you willing, once the President has made his decision, are you willing to come here and tell us, tell the American public, what you actually had recommended to him and whether he followed through with what you recommended?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: I\u2019m not really\u2014what do you mean? Like \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So when the President stands up here, whether it\u2019s, you know, May 1st\u2014whatever day it is\u2014and outlines his plan, are you willing to stand up here after him and tell us all, tell the American public, what it was that you had recommended he do if there is a difference?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: You know, I have to think about that because, you know, when you have conversations with the President, sometimes they really should be confidential in what you give him because he\u2019s going to have to make his own choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019d have to think about that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: So that way we would know whether he was actually listening to the health advice that he\u2019s being provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Right. Yeah. He is. I mean, he\u2014I can tell you one thing: He\u2019ll listen. But I think what\u2019s going to happen\u2014you know, I don\u2019t know for sure\u2014is that he will get input from a number of individuals representing a number of aspects of society; one of them will be health. The only thing that I can tell you is that I will give him the advice based on evidence, my observation of what the best public health approach would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Dr. Fauci?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Yeah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Just to go back to where we started today, which was with the President\u2019s seeming frustrations with some of the reporting about his early decision-making process in January and February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I\u2019m sure you know, the reason we, in the press, do that kind of reporting is so that the next President that comes along, has to deal with a pandemic, can learn some of these lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What\u2014having watched this unfold up close, what do you think were the mistakes that were made early on that a future President could learn from? With the benefit of hindsight, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: You know, I \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Because no President gets everything right, obviously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: I understand. I don\u2019t want to use the word \u201cmistakes,\u201d because when you\u2019re in the\u2014in the fog of war when you\u2019re doing something, you have to make decisions. You get input from a number of individuals. It\u2019s always a moving target. And I just don\u2019t want to be\u2014have anything taken out of context because I already had one of those already in the last couple of days\u2014(laughs)\u2014so I don\u2019t want to go through it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cmistake.\u201d Could things have done better? Of course. I mean, nothing is perfect. And you could always do better. But, I mean, I hesitate to say something is a \u201cmistake.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: But with the benefit of hindsight, with that caveat, what could have been done better?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. FAUCI: Well, I mean, I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t comment about anything outside of my own field. But the thing that, when I think back on, was evolving, in my mind, was something that was a virus that was much worse than what I had thought it was going to be, based on what we had learned early on, when it was first felt to be something that just jumped from an animal to a human, and really didn\u2019t have much capability of going human to human. And then, all of a sudden, you find out that not only was it not just animal to human, but there were a lot of\u2014that\u2019s probably the way it started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then, as you go back and you realize there were probably a lot of infections, that maybe if we had dealt into that a little bit more, we could have learned that not only is it affecting human to human, but it\u2019s transmitting really efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I question myself\u2014I\u2019m not perfect; maybe I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say made \u201cmistakes,\u201d but maybe I should have really tried to delve into that a little bit more about what was going on, but the information wasn\u2019t as forthcoming as I would have liked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then, all of a sudden, when you find out that you\u2019re dealing with something that is not only what had been your worst nightmare\u2014because people ask me that: \u201cWhat is your worst nightmare?\u201d\u2014a brand-new virus that\u2019s respiratory transmitted, that has a high degree of transmissibility, that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality. You know, is that a mistake? Maybe I should have been able to realize that earlier. I\u2019m not sure it was a mistake; it was just an evolving thing that we finally realized and said, \u201cWhoa, this is really worse than we could have imagined.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AIDE: All right. Last one, guys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: When you met with Abbott Laboratories today, what did you ask them to do? What did they say they could do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, we spoke with Abbott Laboratories today about how we can increase significantly the production of cartridges for the 15-minute test. Because, remember, we\u2019re\u2014we are\u2014we\u2019re not only scaling to rapidly expand testing across the country today. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why you heard me and Dr. Birx say that we are\u2014we have an entire team now that\u2019s going to be working with governors and with laboratories around the country to identify the machines that already exist today and that could be activated in doing tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we also\u2014we also want to work with Abbott Laboratories for the longer term. Because if the current trend lines hold\u2014and I hope and I literally pray that we will soon find ourselves on the downslope of the coronavirus in this country\u2014this epidemic, in its current form, will come to an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as we make decisions in the days ahead to reopen America, what President Trump also wants to do is have a policy in place to stay open. And having the kind of surveillance testing available around the country so that CDC can do the immediate contact tracing, when you have a positive test, so that we can deploy resources like the new Abbott 15-minute test specifically to nursing homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke today to Governor Baker in Massachusetts, to Governor Hogan in Maryland, both of whom who have been very innovative implementing federal guidelines for preventing the spread of infectious disease at nursing homes, and we commend them for that. But being able to increase the manufacture of those devices so they can be deployed going forward in the months ahead is also a focal point of our efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, rapidly continuing to expand testing today. And the governor of Louisiana told me today that they had tested at the highest per capita\u2014according to his numbers\u2014of any state in the union. And we congratulate him for that. But making sure that, going forward, we\u2019ll have the infrastructure of testing all across America to deal with the coronavirus should it return in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that, let me\u2014let me bid you all a good evening. And we will be back tomorrow. And \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: Mr. Vice President \u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q: I just have a question about these cartridges and this timeline because the New Hampshire governor says the federal government is in charge of distributing those\u2014FEMA is. So what is the timeline for when they\u2019ll have enough of them? Because they say they don\u2019t have enough. Illinois said they didn\u2019t have enough. So what\u2019s the timeline that you\u2019re working with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, let me\u2014let me let Dr. Birx address that. But there\u2019s a\u2014there was an initial tranche that we purchased. There\u2019s some 18,000 Abbott Laboratory machines around the country, and FEMA acquired a certain amount that were immediately distributed across the states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now Abbott Laboratories is literally producing some 50,000 a day, and those are available in the open market. And we\u2019re also going to be working with Abbott and with the states to deploy those resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we\u2019re also working with other manufacturers to increase the production of cartridges. But if there\u2019s more to that that you want to add, Deb, we\u2019ll make it the last.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR. BIRX: No, that was perfectly said. I just want to\u2014sometimes you ask those questions, and I always want to make sure that people understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a third of them went specifically to Indian Health Service and to these states that have smaller epidemics. Two thirds of it went into the public market, mostly targeted to the places where there is high disease. But only two thirds went that way so that people could purchase them directly, and one third went to the Indian Health Service and to the smaller states that really need these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so I think what we\u2019re trying to do now is balance the entire testing framework of medium-, low-, and high-throughput machines to give everyone the maximum flexibility, state by state, based on what the needs are at that moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there\u2019s an outbreak and you have to do 5,000 tests, you\u2019re not going to do them on an ID NOW machine that takes 15 minutes for every negative, but you\u2019re going to do it on your high-throughput machine. So making sure everybody knows where everything is and what is being run will be really critical moving forward, because we can\u2019t leave anything not on \u2013everything has to be on the table in order for us to be able to dramatically increase testing yet another\u2014we went up by a log in three weeks. So if we\u2019re going to increase again, it\u2019s going to have to be getting every piece of equipment on</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Let just again say thank you all for your time and attention. And thanks to every American who\u2019s joined us tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just want to encourage you we\u2019re going to continue to lean into this effort, to expand testing across the country, to deploy supplies to our incredible healthcare workers that have done such an amazing job in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But my last word, on behalf of the President, on behalf of our entire task force is: It\u2019s \u201c30 Days to Slow the Spread.\u201d And I know we\u2019re almost at the halfway point, and I know it\u2019s been a month of these mitigation strategies, but I hope as you look on, as you see the progress that\u2019s made on the West Coast, the beginnings of real progress in the Greater New York City area, Louisiana, Detroit, and elsewhere\u2014I hope it will only steel your resolve to continue to do your part to slow the spread, because we\u2019ll get through this, but it\u2019ll take all of us to continue to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So thank you to the American people for all your efforts, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "audio": "https://d4q9blt8qjhv3.cloudfront.net/americanpresident/audio/President_Trump_Members_Coronavirus_Task_Force_Hold_Press_Briefing.mp3", "introduction": "<p>During the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump holds usually daily briefings with the task force in charge of coordinating the response to the coronavirus, including members such as Vice President Mike Pence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and Dr. Deborah Birx.
